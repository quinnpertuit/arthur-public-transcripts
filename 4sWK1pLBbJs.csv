"41170","41970"," Check one, two."
"43370","46150"," Check, check."
"68460","69480"," Insert chapters. "
"71020","73580"," I don't know if I can insert chapters here."
"73700","74400"," That's what I'm trying to do."
"75780","77100"," I don't know how to do that. "
"79980","83280"," Okay, let's go right into the, let's get, we gotta get started right away this morning."
"84260","86040"," Okay, so good morning everybody."
"87060","89700"," Give me just one quick moment here. "
"90440","94620"," I'm just gonna post something to a fin to it."
"99640","106100"," I've got a, this morning I've got some, some last minute stuff that I have to do."
"108380","113420"," I guess I think things are gonna get worse around here. "
"113600","115620"," Last night my wife was telling me that."
"119380","122460"," Hold on a second here."
"132280","134600"," And we'll get this posted up here for you this morning. "
"137700","139200"," Okay, so good morning everybody."
"139500","140040"," Happy holidays."
"140900","141840"," Give me just joining us. "
"142000","145120"," I'm gonna try to make this quick before I read what you have to say in chat."
"145500","147580"," I'm just gonna go over the market real quick with you."
"148240","150020"," Now to give you some reference to where we are. "
"151740","152920"," I hope everybody's doing well."
"154640","155520"," Let's take a look here."
"156420","160700"," Okay, so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a look at the market on a couple different"
"160700","161540"," timeframes. "
"162500","166900"," So yesterday, well you remember yesterday when I had said, hey I want to buy down here."
"167780","169540"," And really, really come down here."
"170880","175760"," We had the economic news that came out this morning and then Schumer came out and of course they're"
"175760","178620"," always doing the, I forget every year that the omnibus. "
"179600","184620"," They like to cock tease the omnibus, I guess, every year."
"184780","187540"," So that's being used as an excuse this morning as well as some of the economic data."
"188600","191220"," Half where we're selling off, but there's some interesting stuff here. "
"191440","193120"," So we're gonna take a look at that as a whole this morning."
"194720","198800"," Then we're gonna talk about, I've got a nice storm coming that could be really bad."
"199420","201540"," And the last time they had something like this happen. "
"202240","208220"," Was I think I was told seven years ago they lost some parts of Michigan lost power for up to"
"208220","209000"," two to three weeks."
"210140","212240"," And they're supposed to get very cold."
"212540","216260"," So I have to grab some gas and some oil and some wire and stuff. "
"217500","218840"," All kinds of stupid stuff."
"219080","221660"," Anyways, so we're gonna take a quick look before the market opens."
"222940","228360"," If you're just joining us and we're gonna look just look at the spy complex real quick for the spy. "
"230180","233360"," And the first thing we're gonna look at is the one hour."
"234600","238120"," On the spy and you know the one hour was really nice, right?"
"240440","241560"," Hold on here."
"243700","244860"," I can get rid of that. "
"245140","247060"," That's just the, that's just Christmas."
"248000","252820"," So just looking at the one hour chart, we had a great, a great bottom to buy here, right?"
"253520","254820"," Great bottom to buy through here."
"255079","258640"," One, two, and then we're expecting that third day rip. "
"259760","262420"," On the open, we didn't get that this, we didn't get that this morning."
"263200","265840"," And we, on the, on the, the, a couple of neat things about this morning."
"266140","268180"," On the hourly, we've, we've changed trend. "
"268500","268580"," Okay."
"269800","272920"," And when you see that, you can see us right here."
"273120","274320"," This is the hourly, right?"
"274540","275620"," We're now below the hourly. "
"276540","278000"," You can see where pivot is."
"279420","281960"," And there's a couple of three things I want to show you."
"282140","285820"," So just right there, you, we are now bearish at this point, right?"
"286500","287920"," A trend reversal at this point. "
"289020","291040"," And then in the four hour, we've broken that as well."
"291200","297080"," This is the other key part here is on the four hour, we have confirmation of trend change as well."
"298580","304160"," And that's, that's where the pivot is more closely where the pivot is above here. "
"304740","308280"," And so we are trained or changing trend today."
"308840","311820"," So if anyone's asking you what are we doing today, we're trained, we're changing trend."
"312680","317380"," But that doesn't mean all hope is lost here for you as well as to where we are. "
"317940","319020"," And we're going to take a look at why."
"320380","321920"," You can measure this however you want."
"322440","326860"," We can go straight from 414 or we can just go from the top here and take a look. "
"328580","330560"," Better retracement and usually retracement."
"330680","335390"," You'll see usually that retracement."
"335390","335930"," You'll see. "
"337390","338590"," Take a look here."
"340870","341690"," You'll see it."
"341830","342810"," You'll see the initial move up. "
"343010","343510"," We got it."
"343610","346890"," We kind of got close to this 38% pay money measuring it."
"347190","349870"," I think the 23 can't comes up to this area here. "
"350210","353430"," If you measure from the top, if you do the actual full move."
"354310","358430"," You have some people that are going to tell you that the full moves up here and somebody are going"
"358430","359970"," to tell you that the full move is below."
"360870","362970"," You can actually see this 23% right here. "
"364390","366230"," We have that 23%."
"366230","367190"," And normally retracement."
"368110","373390"," You know, as Tesla you'd see retracement, sometimes it comes up to 61.8%. It's so volatile. "
"374830","375930"," Sometimes you get even higher."
"376810","378990"," You get 78% on Tesla because it's so volatile."
"379270","380010"," But usually retracement. "
"380010","381050"," Not always."
"381270","385370"," Sometimes you'll have continuation down and continue to move down."
"386050","390070"," But usually in spy, you'll sometimes see we talked about this yesterday where you'll see the one"
"390070","390470"," move up. "
"391130","395430"," Then you'll see the next move to the 38%."
"395430","399450"," And sometimes you'll even see us go higher into end of month."
"400250","401470"," I showed you this yesterday, right?"
"401630","404650"," I prefer to see something like this on the spy. "
"404650","408890"," So we're taking that into account this morning and we do have the rollover."
"409510","413110"," If you're a bull, you're looking for some kind of a bottoming pattern to buy."
"414570","420870"," Either down at S2 or even S3 to buy or at least to check to see if we have any"
"420870","423850"," kind of continuation to higher numbers, right?"
"424590","428870"," So this morning, the one thing I want to give to you is that we're in reversal. "
"428910","433930"," I wouldn't expect the dip to be bought today unless it's somewhere around S2."
"434770","436630"," And possibly even S3, okay?"
"438370","441150"," Keep that in mind on retracement."
"441230","442210"," So you got the first retracement. "
"442310","443550"," We got 23%."
"443550","445510"," Do I think the retracement is over?"
"445690","447630"," Probably not for the month."
"447770","448190"," It could be. "
"450610","451830"," I'm open to both."
"452630","456490"," I'm really not concerned with is the retracement over."
"457790","460550"," Are we going to see a dip bought down here or not?"
"461110","461990"," Because once we get there. "
"463210","470650"," Once we get there, that's the inflection point for a bull to see if this gets bought again, right?"
"471250","478030"," And you'll know if it gets bought because you'll see the one hour or four hour come down and you'll"
"478030","479330"," either see this cross here."
"480250","483830"," Or you'll see the rejection for further down, right?"
"485170","487710"," So let's say we go all the way down to S3, right?"
"488410","491150"," And this is your EMA down here."
"492850","494450"," And your EMA comes all the way down. "
"494590","496330"," Let's say I don't care if it's today or tomorrow doesn't matter."
"498570","501490"," And if we start, we keep selling down here, right?"
"502410","507070"," And if it rejects here, you know, we know that there's another move, another leg down, right?"
"507550","511390"," If it doesn't reject and it starts to make its way above."
"514880","515419"," See here. "
"517559","518860"," Hold on a second here."
"519360","519820"," Hold on."
"520860","524460"," We actually cross above that blue line and start making our way up. "
"524620","526920"," You know, you can jump right back into that bull trade above."
"528720","533460"," So if you're trying to time the market or anything like that as a bull, you shouldn't be here."
"533460","538900"," This is no place for you to be trying to bottom here by bottom here. "
"539000","545940"," And let's just see a crossover of the one hour on the one hour 21 day EMA."
"546300","547200"," Does that make sense to you?"
"548180","550760"," I'm going to be I'm going to be popping out of here this morning."
"551400","557760"," So I'm going to leave the live stream on for you, but I want you to have the idea of"
"557760","564460"," confirmation for another leg higher to test the test higher highs in this trade into end of month"
"564460","567960"," into into Christmas into end of month for for January. "
"568900","573780"," And otherwise we're we're bearish here underneath the CMA and they'll probably try to tee off it"
"573780","576080"," until we get to S two or S three at some point."
"577640","580600"," So just be conscious of that as the day unfolds today."
"585740","586700"," I can tell you one second. "
"592840","594600"," Trying to get some water down inside of me."
"595200","599500"," I've been outside in the freezing cold early morning trying to make sure my house is ready to go"
"599500","601800"," for a snowpocalypse."
"604320","607380"," That's what does that mean for you here is. "
"608940","612980"," That trend reversal is going to be today this this view up right."
"613620","615000"," And you can go right."
"615220","618840"," You can go right to just the one hour chart. "
"621660","623240"," Just like we talked about before."
"625240","627520"," We'll put some we'll put some lines here for you."
"628980","630020"," For the chart today. "
"632000","634640"," But on your own chart I want you to just just go back and check."
"636400","637100"," Be hourly."
"638180","640620"," Does any kind of a pull back or pull higher. "
"642040","645660"," Let's go back and check the EMA and see if we break above it."
"648150","653210"," If they tee off S one if they tee off the S the estimated moving average in the one hour"
"653210","654370"," chart if they tee off pivot."
"654370","656570"," Anything down here is bearish. "
"656670","656870"," Okay."
"657030","657930"," I'm going to be aware of that."
"658110","659090"," That's bearish at this point. "
"661390","663110"," So go back to a 15 minute chart."
"663650","664610"," Kind of looks wonky doesn't it."
"667590","668510"," Hold on a second here. "
"670650","671430"," Five minutes."
"676530","677850"," Maybe have to reset the chart."
"678050","678730"," So it's not so weird. "
"691810","693490"," I'm going to reset this chart here."
"697180","699980"," So just as a matter of today you're going to expect."
"700380","704640"," Even if this gets bought here you're going to expect bears to step right back in above here. "
"705360","707400"," Three to four or thirty eight or so."
"708520","710480"," And three to five forty three."
"712440","717080"," You're not going and you can trade this on the five minute if we you can trade this above on"
"717080","717960"," the eight EMA. "
"718380","722080"," But I'd be aware of these levels above here for sellers today."
"723340","727980"," And when you do a retracement it's normal to get up there right."
"728680","731600"," You hit the first retracement level you come back down you look for support. "
"731840","737500"," We talked about this yesterday about it really feel better about buying the retracement sell off"
"737500","741420"," down here and allowing the market for the next leg up."
"741640","741660"," Right."
"741820","747780"," This is a natural progression and how the stock market trades to put this in the trash here. "
"756060","757020"," Okay we see here."
"762160","767640"," So if you're a bear out there you're trying to tee off on three places you're trying to tee off."
"768280","771720"," Right on S1 you've got another place up here about three to four fifty. "
"772620","775580"," And then of course the pivot line to send this lower."
"776440","784390"," Like this if you're a bull you're more than likely not guaranteed be more than likely to."
"784730","790770"," Looking to see a crossover on the one hour down below here at S2 at S3. "
"791210","796290"," If you're a bear you're looking to get down to this S3 level and retest the prior lows that we"
"796290","796550"," had."
"800640","807520"," Back here at three seventy seven eighty five and just off of just off of the open here."
"808680","810960"," We're going to go right back to this previous low here. "
"811040","812280"," This is uber bearish right."
"812740","818720"," We break this previous low right here and we're going to we're going to change this closer here."
"819220","820460"," Let me just look at here. "
"825040","827600"," Make that nice and small so you can see that previous low."
"828000","830360"," We have another previous low down here at S3."
"834360","838640"," And then we have another previous low way down here. "
"839560","840040"," Okay."
"840140","841180"," You want to be aware of those?"
"844800","847460"," Trading above the five minute EMA right now."
"847940","853300"," US stocks extending their forward off the open hairs the nose back down by around one spot zero"
"853300","853940"," eight percent. "
"854780","855680"," Just a second here."
"857140","857820"," All right."
"858540","862680"," And then I want to show you one last thing and that's just the chat yesterday we had we had"
"862680","862860"," some. "
"863140","869180"," A couple things happen in chat yesterday and even myself we had reviewed Tesla yesterday right."
"870120","875840"," So what I'm going to try to do is insert chapters into the videos as we live stream."
"876280","877640"," So if we let's say we cover Tesla. "
"878740","883300"," I'll try to put a chapter in so that you can go back and reference whenever we spoke about Tesla."
"885620","888280"," And let me see if I can read with these rules say the rules are basic."
"890180","899160"," They're not they're not big rules, but I want to review them real quick. "
"899160","900680"," We all like bears and bulls here."
"900840","902080"," If you don't like bears, you don't like bulls."
"902140","903440"," This might not be the place for you. "
"904480","906320"," Well, my view, we're all retail traders."
"906720","907820"," So we should be helping each other out."
"908680","912120"," If you're a bear and you've got a great point, you should make that point and argue it. "
"912160","916100"," If somebody doesn't like your your take on it, you shouldn't be a troll like troll them out or"
"916100","916340"," whatever."
"916660","918100"," Same thing with bulls back and forth."
"918320","921780"," Try to help each other out for retail traders trying to fight the machine right to make a living"
"921780","922040"," here. "
"922900","925820"," Sometimes the host is not able to read the entire chat."
"926400","931920"," So please don't spam questions to me repetitively until you can get my attention."
"931980","936260"," Sometimes I'm working in the background with you guys trying to get information out to you. "
"936340","937980"," So I can't I can't always read the chat."
"938440","943320"," It'll scroll by and it's I try to go back is whenever I have time I'll go back and try"
"943320","944000"," to read the chat."
"944540","952020"," If you do get a super chat, it will pop up on my screen so that you can I'll see"
"952020","952200"," it. "
"952300","952860"," Like it won't leave."
"952860","955120"," It just sits on my screen until I address it."
"956200","957920"," So it's something that's very important to you. "
"958220","961480"," I think that's the only way right now that I can guarantee that I answer question for you."
"961760","963300"," I also want you guys to be nice to each other."
"963700","966680"," It's amazing what happens when we can all be nice to each other. "
"966740","971140"," You'd be surprised when you're nice to somebody where if you disagree with them, agree with them or"
"971140","973320"," whatever it pays dividends down the road."
"974160","977380"," I do love joking and having fun inside the chat."
"977380","980500"," So I don't want you to think that you can't joke and post whatever you want in the chat. "
"980780","983120"," The chat is generally speaking 90% of time."
"983360","984000"," Awesome sauce."
"985240","988100"," But I just don't want you to cross into the line of trolling. "
"988120","990700"," If you get angry or anything, just let it just blow off the steam."
"991240","996440"," And then the last thing would be the moderators are inside of this this YouTube show."
"997120","1000660"," I want you to I want you to follow their instructions even if you disagree with them. "
"1001140","1006720"," You can always come back and email me DM me or DM the moderator on the side."
"1006720","1008140"," On the side of a public chat."
"1009040","1011360"," If you disagree with some kind of decision that they've made. "
"1011680","1015500"," The reason why I ask you to follow their instructions is because they have their own lives."
"1015800","1019100"," They're doing this out of the kind of side of the heart during the day."
"1019180","1020580"," They're here every day all day long. "
"1021560","1024140"," And they're just trying to make it a constructive place."
"1025040","1027400"," That doesn't mean I don't like you if you're a follower."
"1027740","1029040"," I like all of you guys out there. "
"1029040","1034359"," But we try to try to keep the chat productive and fun."
"1035560","1037839"," And we can always address it on the side."
"1038000","1042760"," So just kind of having a public disagreement on the chat unless it's something weird. "
"1043020","1047400"," Like if I'm treating you bad or something like that or not treating you with respect, I can"
"1047400","1048500"," understand you blowing up the chat."
"1048680","1051720"," But other than that, just try to be nice to each other."
"1051860","1056000"," If you disagree with something try to DM somebody in the side or DM me or I have an email"
"1056000","1057360"," in my about page. "
"1057360","1060120"," You can always email me and be like, Hey man, I'm not happy with this."
"1060160","1061120"," I didn't like this today."
"1061600","1062640"," I can understand that. "
"1062840","1066080"," There's things I don't like sometimes and I get frustrated as well."
"1066220","1071900"," But there's no reason to be getting frustrated watching a YouTube channel with me here."
"1071940","1072960"," I want you guys to have a great day. "
"1073400","1075020"," Honestly, I know it gets stressful."
"1076280","1081020"," I just try to have some patience with each other when you're on this live stream."
"1081360","1085040"," Please have some respect for the moderators here because they're here every day. "
"1086400","1087980"," They come back every single day."
"1088080","1091940"," They're here in and out six hours a day, seven hours a day with us."
"1092900","1094620"," And so just try to respect those guys. "
"1095220","1098860"," If you're spamming stuff inside of the chat, you're going to get hidden."
"1099340","1100220"," It's some kind of a timeout."
"1100480","1105040"," If it's like 15 minutes, half an hour or whatever, that's how it goes. "
"1106920","1109500"," It's not it's a policy towards everybody."
"1109500","1110700"," It's not just one person."
"1111980","1112340"," Okay. "
"1112460","1113080"," So that's all that."
"1113480","1114840"," That's how clean house that away."
"1115880","1117820"," I want to say good morning to all of you out there. "
"1118300","1120320"," I hope you guys are all doing well."
"1120320","1121660"," Hope you guys are all going to have a great holiday."
"1122380","1124540"," I do want one of the house cleaning thing. "
"1125000","1128640"," If I do lose power, sometimes around here, I'll lose power and not Internet."
"1129540","1132120"," I do have a generator, a whole house generator."
"1132400","1133800"," It's not completely hooked up right now. "
"1134480","1135860"," I'm hoping to get it hooked up today."
"1136340","1137640"," Like a final hook up today."
"1139220","1146020"," Directly to my box so that I can just flip the breaker and flip the other breaker with the lockout"
"1146020","1148900"," thing and be finished with that. "
"1149220","1151580"," Now, sometimes I do lose power and Internet."
"1152120","1158260"," If I do lose power and Internet overnight or tomorrow, I'll still update via Twitter for my phone"
"1158260","1160520"," that my Internet is out for tomorrow."
"1163020","1165160"," So I may not be on tomorrow. "
"1166760","1169060"," I'd give it like a 50% chance."
"1169320","1170620"," I'm right around 50%."
"1170620","1176620"," The problem that's going on is it's going to rain first, not even freezing rain. "
"1176780","1179960"," It's like raining and then they were getting some kind of weird temperature drop."
"1180800","1183880"," Like a 30 degree temperature drop or something crazy like that."
"1184280","1186260"," So everything that's wet is going to freeze. "
"1187580","1192160"," The electrical infrastructure in this entire state is some of the worst I've seen in the country."
"1192160","1195260"," I've lived all over the country and this is one of the worst."
"1195560","1196860"," This is like Arkansas, Texas. "
"1197900","1202280"," Like a poll with some some some third world country wire hanging up on it."
"1202920","1204860"," And they just don't do a good job here."
"1204920","1206240"," They don't bury anything here. "
"1206360","1207140"," Everything's out in the open."
"1209940","1210820"," Yeah, try not to have drama."
"1211160","1213900"," You got why you guys have a great great time here all the time. "
"1214600","1215780"," It's have a great time."
"1215960","1216960"," I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings."
"1217540","1218540"," I know people's get feelings get hurt. "
"1218660","1219280"," I love all you guys."
"1219480","1223300"," So just try to have some patience with each other."
"1223680","1226720"," You guys have enough of that shit with your wives and husbands, right?"
"1226940","1228460"," Don't you guys have enough shit in your own life?"
"1228940","1229740"," You don't want to have it here. "
"1229880","1230660"," You want to have a good time."
"1232880","1233300"," Look at it."
"1235080","1235920"," Let's take a look at. "
"1238560","1239880"," Yeah, that's nothing back there."
"1243080","1245160"," That's a previous high from two days ago."
"1247320","1248240"," We're tapping right now. "
"1248340","1249140"," That means nothing to me."
"1259940","1261440"," Okay, let's see what you guys are in here right now."
"1262740","1263540"," Good morning, John. "
"1263760","1264020"," How are you?"

"1320580","1322320"," Merry Christmas to you, Paul."
"1324400","1325820"," Get your guns ready for the apocalypse."
"1326380","1327240"," Dude, I thought that was happening. "
"1327700","1330040"," I was living here in Detroit, and COVID happened."
"1331140","1334360"," I was like, I can't even tell you what some of the things I was doing."
"1334540","1336840"," I was like, we're going to have some blood in the streets there. "
"1338840","1339200"," Morning."
"1339200","1339540"," Morning."
"1339540","1339920"," Morning cheese. "
"1340200","1340480"," How are you?"
"1340760","1341400"," Yeah, I bought some."
"1342080","1343340"," Matter of fact, I'm still holding them."
"1343360","1346640"," I haven't even looked at my brokerage. "
"1347080","1348340"," I had a small stack."
"1348560","1348900"," Very small."
"1349140","1351580"," As a matter of fact, I bought them at the worst time. "
"1351660","1354640"," I bought them somewhere in here."
"1355100","1355880"," Way up here."
"1356120","1357040"," I was just like, yeah, you know what?"
"1357260","1357920"," Just in case. "
"1358940","1359600"," But it wasn't."
"1360040","1362080"," I mean, it's so much yesterday that it wasn't a big deal."
"1363660","1366200"," Oh, I've got something from Joe Harper in here. "
"1366760","1367840"," Let me go through Java."
"1368060","1368840"," Let me get through and just."
"1369360","1371200"," Good morning. "
"1372160","1372220"," Sue."

"1372780","1372980"," Good morning."
"1373100","1373480"," Kid time. "

"1375920","1376320"," Yep."
"1376480","1376740"," Yep."
"1376960","1377300"," Yep. "
"1377520","1378220"," Grab some wire."
"1378740","1383580"," I got to grab some wire and go grab some wire and make sure I have it all kind of"
"1383580","1384000"," wired up."
"1384200","1385520"," I just don't have the finishing. "
"1386460","1390200"," I don't have the finishing stuff from the inside to the box."
"1392240","1393960"," You hold your futures overnight right on."
"1393960","1395140"," Good morning, everybody. "
"1395420","1396080"," Good morning to all of them."
"1396240","1396480"," Emerson."
"1396480","1397100"," Good morning to you. "
"1398620","1399480"," Good morning, Emerson."
"1401080","1402320"," Happy holidays to you, brother."
"1405020","1406580"," Yeah, it's right down here, right?"
"1406860","1407540"," We were right here. "
"1407860","1408480"," This is exactly."
"1408800","1409500"," This is pretty much."
"1411560","1412140"," We're at. "
"1412400","1415300"," So actually, yeah, though, this is where I wanted it to be right here."
"1415940","1418600"," And we broke right below the one hour in for our this morning."
"1419240","1420520"," So we've definitely changed trend. "
"1421300","1422100"," Good morning, Joe, Harper."
"1424380","1425580"," No, I got no malt liquor."
"1426160","1426960"," No malt liquor. "
"1427220","1428260"," No, we got water."
"1429440","1430600"," I haven't drank or anything."
"1432040","1433060"," Went to bed last night. "
"1433260","1433940"," Now, that's a good morning."
"1434600","1435340"," Sheriff, good morning."
"1435620","1435900"," Wicked face. "
"1436080","1436360"," Good morning."
"1437580","1439420"," First hand, Joe, Josh is in the house."
"1440260","1441220"," Hey, Merry Christmas, Josh. "
"1441460","1441820"," How are you, brother?"
"1442600","1443140"," Good to see you."
"1446580","1448040"," You've got some put spreads right on."
"1451040","1453680"," Old dirty dog Joe Joe Joe Joe's in the house this morning. "
"1455620","1456560"," Happy holidays, brother."
"1458380","1459340"," We do have some sketch."
"1459620","1460020"," Go on down. "
"1460160","1460660"," Don't we, Emerson?"
"1463060","1463620"," Love you."
"1463680","1464080"," Make your face."
"1465320","1467780"," One indicators are active when you do our check cap. "
"1467780","1470140"," Mary, Mary, Jim, right on first hand, brother."
"1471040","1472280"," I think the blue one is 21."
"1472560","1472600"," Yep. "
"1475040","1475440"," Yeah."
"1475840","1477280"," I haven't looked at Tesla yet either."
"1477280","1479240"," So I'll have to take a look at Tesla at some point this morning. "
"1480820","1482760"," There was some sabotage this morning, right?"
"1485400","1486480"," Let's take a look over here."
"1487220","1492740"," So you guys are all caught up on the, you guys are all caught up on."
"1492880","1494860"," We hit our first target on the retracement. "
"1495760","1499380"," Now, the hope would be that we find the bottom at S2 S3."
"1500700","1503120"," You want to be, so we're down almost to S3 now."
"1503260","1506820"," So if you were at home right now and you're like, okay, Cap. "
"1506820","1508360"," I'm a bull or okay, Cap."
"1508580","1508940"," I'm a bear."
"1510540","1511440"," Thank God for you. "
"1511540","1511880"," Good morning."
"1512500","1512960"," How are you doing?"
"1513140","1514000"," Hey, Ben, give me a shot."
"1514200","1514820"," Give me a text, please. "
"1515380","1517440"," I got a new iPhone and I don't have your number on my phone anymore."
"1518000","1519020"," How's Montana doing, brother?"
"1519780","1520580"," Hope I was well."
"1523690","1525730"," I don't know my brokerage here. "
"1538550","1541150"," I was like, oh, I was like, those weren't worth shit off the bell anyways."
"1542170","1545090"," I think they were like, they were either 30 or 60 cents."
"1545290","1545690"," I don't remember. "
"1562960","1564580"," They were 390 C's."
"1565220","1566660"," I don't think those are going to print today."
"1566660","1571900"," I should have sold them off the bell and I didn't. "
"1575170","1575530"," Ooh."
"1579750","1581330"," Oh, yeah, I'm a gala, boy."
"1586140","1587680"," I'm going up to get some whiskey today. "
"1587780","1589200"," We had someone bought me a bottle."
"1590360","1593780"," So I'm going to get some whiskey and tomorrow we're going to have a great show."
"1593900","1594760"," We'll drink whiskey together. "
"1595580","1596720"," So make sure you're here tomorrow, Paul."
"1598560","1599440"," I got like three."
"1599600","1601380"," I got like three cousins named Paul too. "
"1604260","1605980"," Is it minus 42 degrees Ben?"
"1608900","1611520"," Mike, you're probably thought up to 75 P's are up today."
"1613560","1615000"," I don't know when we're going to drink tomorrow."
"1615180","1616180"," I haven't told my wife yet. "
"1616320","1619380"," She's going to be so upset because this morning, right?"
"1619500","1624160"," You get that wake up rationale or it's like the morning rationale is like the exact opposite of the"
"1624160","1624820"," nighttime rationale."
"1625800","1627640"," But at the same time, it's still a crazy rationale."
"1627880","1629520"," This morning, I'm like, because then we got early. "
"1629520","1630740"," I'm going to crack it on."
"1631400","1635780"," And I'm like, man, if I bake that post, I tell them we're going to drink bourbon."
"1635880","1638700"," I'm like, what time do we actually start drinking bourbon on Friday?"
"1639400","1645720"," I'm like, we could be shit faced by like 10 a.m. We'll be cutting the live stream short. "
"1647800","1649280"," My wife will be so upset."
"1653950","1655970"," Grubster, you're traveling tomorrow?"
"1656330","1657070"," Stay safe, brother."
"1657750","1658490"," Happy Holidays, man. "
"1661960","1662900"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"1663140","1663600"," Thank you, Ben."
"1665260","1667180"," Right now I'm going to catch up with you today, Ben. "
"1670020","1670900"," Joey Harper."
"1672080","1673120"," My man."
"1673960","1676900"," Oh, yeah, Dylan. "
"1678520","1680420"," Artisanal Mezcal from Oaxaca today."
"1681120","1682420"," I love Oaxaca cuisine, by the way."
"1684280","1685340"," That sounds delicious. "
"1686740","1688600"," I was thinking about retiring in Mexico."
"1688940","1692200"," If I had to have my last house, I was thinking about Mexico."
"1696680","1697540"," Right on Grubster. "
"1698480","1701500"," All right, so if you're a bull in a bear, it doesn't matter."
"1701580","1702840"," If you're a bull or a bear, it really doesn't matter."
"1703840","1704620"," Merry Christmas, Ben. "
"1705940","1707640"," You're going to be looking at the one-hour chart, right?"
"1707940","1709320"," We're going to go right back to that one-hour chart."
"1710780","1715080"," And you're going to be sitting there saying yourself, well, Captain, I bought a dip here."
"1715300","1717180"," What does the one-hour chart tell you is no, right?"
"1718660","1720540"," One-hour chart is telling you, hell no. "
"1720720","1722280"," We're going to test these lows down here, right?"
"1724000","1726700"," Now, four-hour chart is telling you the same thing, right?"
"1728360","1734040"," So if you wanted to pick up a trade and safety here, you want to see that, you want to"
"1734040","1740680"," see that retracement, then that next move higher for confirmation."
"1741780","1742380"," We're down here."
"1742480","1744440"," You can see this nice stretch here, right?"
"1744840","1747380"," And you're going to expect that same stretch down here. "
"1747420","1748220"," I'm going to show you where."
"1753960","1756280"," Remember this down here, right?"
"1757660","1759500"," You don't want to be getting down here, do you?"
"1761120","1765120"," Get that higher low, that lower low, then way down here at 376."
"1767000","1768840"," You don't want to see us get down here, do you?"
"1770460","1774500"," We have no gaps to fill down there, so we're looking for a dip to get bought down here. "
"1781020","1783180"," I'm going to be looking for a trend change down here."
"1797420","1798500"," I'm going to put this back up."
"1815040","1817340"," Yes, I don't see where I can insert chapters here. "
"1817420","1819180"," I'm going to see if I can insert chapters here."
"1820940","1822200"," Let me just a second here."
"1822260","1824400"," I want to see if I can insert an actual chapter here. "
"1826860","1829460"," I'm going to do a little something in the background here real quick."
"1832340","1839180"," If I can insert chapters, then what I can do is, when you guys are asking about a ticker, I"
"1839180","1840860"," can say, hey, we looked at GME it."
"1841820","1843720"," I put a chapter and we looked at GME. "
"1844680","1847440"," Let me see if I can do that."
"1853600","1855480"," While we're alive, sometimes you can't."
"1857720","1858940"," Let me look and see. "
"1859120","1861800"," Sometimes you only do it once the video is done processing and all that."
"1862640","1864420"," It's not saying that I can yet."
"1864740","1873920"," Analytics, options, comments, subtitles, settings. "
"1876780","1878200"," I'm not seeing it."
"1878740","1879220"," Content."
"1879940","1881240"," I think it has to be done. "
"1881380","1882460"," That's the one problem."
"1884420","1885340"," Analytics, maybe."
"1885920","1886900"," I'm just going to do an analytics. "
"1888160","1888600"," Nope."
"1889960","1891120"," I'm not seeing it here."
"1892760","1893700"," That's kind of sucks. "
"1893880","1894700"," I wish I could put in."
"1895140","1900300"," Maybe I'll just have to write down every day where I'm able to write down every day at a time"
"1900300","1906260"," or the time when we talk about stuff and then I'll plug them in after the videos in post"
"1906260","1906600"," production."
"1907700","1908160"," Okay. "
"1908640","1909300"," We can do that."
"1909800","1910760"," I'll do it by time."
"1910880","1912900"," I'll just remember the time. "
"1912920","1917700"," The Senate has a deal to vote on the amendments and the spending bill."
"1922660","1923940"," I've been a dirty bear cap."
"1924160","1925460"," 20% gains this warrant. "
"1925720","1927920"," So I'm just giving love right on each rating shorts."
"1927980","1928540"," Thanks, brother."
"1929020","1929900"," I appreciate it. "
"1934060","1936400"," I'm holding puts until the worth is like a bear should."
"1941630","1942170"," Yeah, man."
"1942270","1943110"," It's going to be crazy here. "
"1943290","1944990"," It's going to be, it's going to be absolutely wild there."
"1951380","1952460"," You're looking for entry."
"1954140","1956040"," Yeah, no, I'm not ready for Estau long here. "
"1957600","1960680"," Typically on retreat, you guys are going to talk to each other in chats."
"1961100","1963360"," Normally, we'll go back and let's look at, let's have an Estau."
"1963980","1967660"," Joe Harper is asking about the Estau, so we'll do this one more time. "
"1969180","1977070"," So let's look at a, sometimes you only get one retracement, right?"
"1977370","1981530"," Sometimes you only, if you, if you come up, sometimes you only get the one retracement you'll get."
"1982630","1983830"," Yeah, that down move, right?"
"1983970","1985870"," You come back up and you just start heading lower again."
"1988670","1990910"," Well, we're looking for this, I'm looking for this 50 bot. "
"1991110","1994930"," I don't think that the quote unquote holiday rally is over."
"1994930","1997350"," I'm looking for a second."
"1997650","1999690"," This is, I think this is 50% up here. "
"2000670","2005930"," I'm looking for at least that intent of year, possibly even the 70, I think it's 71."
"2006230","2006350"," Hold on."
"2007050","2007910"," That's the 68. "
"2008110","2009150"," I mean, one second."
"2010910","2015610"," In 10 minutes time out the top of the hour, you get the US leading index change month over month"
"2015610","2020410"," for cost minus zero spot 5% from the prior minus zero spot 80%."
"2020410","2023090"," We kind of hit that 23% right there, right?"
"2023250","2023690"," Like it was nothing. "
"2024370","2027350"," If it was Tesla, you could go as high as 78%."
"2027350","2028890"," You go all the way back up here."
"2029210","2031410"," There's still this gap above that needs to be filled up here. "
"2032530","2038410"," We failed this gap, which makes sense, but I'm still looking for, you know, something like this,"
"2038450","2041130"," something like we talked about failure here yesterday."
"2042070","2043810"," I'd like to see this dip get bought."
"2045150","2049989"," And I'd like to see us make our way at least to 38% and maybe we get the failure. "
"2051010","2055550"," But I always like to see at least one or two tries before before told no."
"2055889","2061630"," And if we get the failure here, that would be another way to be looking at another attempt here and"
"2061630","2063030"," then at least head down that way."
"2063750","2066989"," But just the straight failure and bloodbath crash the market. "
"2066989","2067770"," I don't see it."
"2069070","2069969"," Or I don't see it."
"2070030","2072850"," I don't think that they want to do it right now heading into Christmas. "
"2073110","2073310"," We might."
"2076250","2080190"," So the trade here for a bear is take this down at least to test this bottom."
"2081730","2084650"," And then if you want to pick it back up, it's not until after you break below this, right?"
"2085429","2087110"," This is kind of no man's land down here. "
"2088130","2092389"," And then if you wanted to do that continuation trade down, you could."
"2093850","2099390"," But, you know, until then for today, you're looking for a bounce here at S two S three or even"
"2099390","2101330"," tomorrow could take until tomorrow."
"2102490","2104310"," And then a continuation up. "
"2106880","2113300"," Just the overall thought process and how bearish are we how long we bears for that kind of stuff."
"2114640","2116200"," So then get rid of this crap for you."
"2121370","2122130"," Come on now. "
"2122130","2132260"," Yeah, we"
"2132260","2133300"," haven't closed this gap yet."
"2133500","2139770"," So bearish on the day, not bearish on a break yet."
"2139990","2144770"," Must we start to break below this S three and even this even this previous low back here. "
"2146010","2147430"," I want to see some continuation."
"2148070","2149030"," This is kind of like the didn't."
"2149270","2151170"," This is kind of like the no deadline here, right?"
"2151450","2152390"," You don't diddle down in here. "
"2153830","2156570"," But to get to S three, perfectly fine."
"2159330","2160450"," Perfectly believe in that trade."
"2160970","2162710"," We'd like to see on the five minute. "
"2165230","2166650"," If you look close right here."
"2172700","2175720"," I really like to see some kind of retracement off S two."
"2176880","2178500"," And you just sell off VWOP. "
"2178940","2179980"," That'll be your first short."
"2180600","2183000"," Your next short and the next one would be on this five minute right here."
"2183980","2185700"," You could get the rest short to right here. "
"2186260","2188160"," Tag a S three and that would be nice."
"2189420","2190300"," Now for the day."
"2195020","2197640"," So let me know if there was a leave it on the five minutes so you can see it. "
"2203020","2206180"," So you can see where we're to take the next short on on a yes."
"2216200","2217600"," SD look that's that long again."
"2217700","2218240"," Yeah, probably not. "
"2219260","2224740"," If you could do us down on a weekly time frame, but they're like the big hedge."
"2224800","2226180"," I wouldn't take that trade yet."
"2227860","2229080"," I'm not in that trade out there. "
"2229160","2231280"," I'm looking for at least 38%."
"2231980","2232820"," Maybe 50."
"2234320","2235540"," Six day would be prime. "
"2237480","2241160"," We're not done going down the market as well on a medium to long term for."
"2241300","2243700"," Like a long term forecast market as in bottoms."
"2244240","2247860"," On a medium term forecast, even just like this next month or two. "
"2248380","2251480"," We still have not hit a oversold condition yet."
"2266560","2267900"," You can make clips of the video."
"2268500","2269900"," I'm streaming them posts in some place. "
"2271780","2275420"," You know, we can get you some, you mean to get you access to the YouTube channel so you can"
"2275420","2276000"," post them there."
"2277140","2280140"," The opponent's PK and all in says that you gas price."
"2280180","2281220"," I'll work on getting you access. "
"2281480","2283540"," I can post them on the YouTube channel price volatility."
"2290130","2291970"," It's my work on that on the background."
"2292690","2293730"," Good morning, Captain Ron. "
"2294030","2294650"," Happy holidays, brother."
"2294830","2295030"," How are you?"
"2299370","2303750"," So whenever they pass the omnibus, it's my, for my recollection of it."
"2305090","2309110"," Every year, I forget that they, they cock tease with it and they, that's what they do. "
"2309470","2312470"," It ends up taking like a couple of weeks to a month."
"2312870","2316690"," So far when it's now to the top of the hour, where do you get the USB index change month"
"2316690","2317170"," over month?"
"2317170","2324510"," We'll cost minus 0.5% prior minus 0.8%. If they run it up typically into, if they run"
"2324510","2327830"," it up typically into the omnibus bill, they'll sell it off."
"2328890","2330590"," It's a, they'll call it a solid news event. "
"2330850","2332950"," If we're low when they pass it, we'll normally rip higher."
"2336570","2337270"," Yeah, man, producer."
"2340870","2341490"," Hell yeah. "
"2346520","2349780"," Test is on looking for 129.85. I'll have an look at that test."
"2349940","2350720"," I'll take a look right now."
"2352100","2355220"," I'll close my cover calls and Tesla bullish, made a clip of that analysis. "
"2355940","2356540"," Thanks, thanks, Winky."
"2359100","2360320"," Yeah, let's look at Tesla real quick."
"2362700","2363340"," We'll take a look at Tesla. "
"2370780","2373440"," Thanks for making that link available, Winky."
"2380410","2381370"," It's a good Tesla."
"2399460","2401280"," So you bring up Tesla here. "
"2408370","2411090"," We need the new book map here."
"2417250","2421510"," So yesterday, we looked at Tesla and we, I'll have a second here."
"2423770","2428050"," On Tesla we had, we finally hit that 136.07 right around the open. "
"2428210","2432490"," I think it was like 135.8 or something was the actual tag."
"2434630","2435530"," Traded up yesterday."
"2435930","2439190"," Traded up on the retracement channel here yesterday. "
"2439710","2445130"," Talked about buying one of these lows with a call spread for a week out."
"2445130","2456660"," I think, I think we said the 30th with a price target of, you said a price target of, I"
"2456660","2457220"," think it was 149."
"2459300","2468700"," I think it was right up in here, 149 a spread from a spread from 129 to 149"
"2468700","2470440"," for the new year, right?"
"2470740","2474330"," Right in here for 1230. "
"2474330","2478710"," And then we said to buy some dirt cheap puts, right?"
"2478850","2485970"," I think we said 128 or 130s to hedge the bet because they were like 20 cents, right?"
"2487370","2489570"," And we're now down to 132."
"2490170","2496250"," So if you took that trade yesterday, we said if it bled off to cut the call side loose of"
"2496250","2502690"," the call spread and monetize with the cheap puts down here, let's look at what those costs right"
"2502690","2502990"," now."
"2514260","2517720"," Yeah, so those are now $1.35, right?"
"2517960","2520100"," So those have gone up how much percentage?"
"2521100","2522220"," So I think you're good. "
"2522340","2525420"," If you took that trade yesterday, I think you've made money in this trade today."
"2526900","2527660"," Is that right?"
"2534240","2534840"," Is that correct?"
"2540650","2545970"," I think yesterday we talked about, I think we talked about this trade yesterday with a call spread"
"2545970","2553670"," for the 30th and to hedge the spread with some 30 cent puts for Tesla, right?"
"2553910","2554130"," Down here?"
"2555170","2556670"," So you have a free call spread now."
"2556730","2558610"," If you didn't even touch it, we just monetize the puts. "
"2559530","2562050"," You now have a free call spread for the 30th, right?"
"2562430","2562890"," Does that make sense?"
"2564010","2564950"," Are they getting this right?"
"2566510","2567970"," Let me know if I'm getting this right or wrong."
"2572700","2574000"," Because we have it on the tape, right?"
"2574340","2575020"," I think we have it on the tape."
"2577220","2579900"," Let's put the, let's put today's levels in for Tesla. "
"2583010","2583770"," Let me see here."
"2585410","2586470"," It'll be just a second."
"2594810","2599720"," I mean, just a moment here. "
"2600480","2601800"," We'll set up Tesla here."
"2609730","2617560"," 138.24. Close enough."
"2624720","2625440"," Pivot, baby. "
"2630580","2632620"," It's your pivot point right here."
"2633440","2634840"," Just some cap blocks on this."
"2637220","2643480"," First support is 135.22. Right there. "
"2643920","2654960"," And second support is at 132.87. What was"
"2654960","2655140"," that?"
"2655840","2656980"," What was that nonsense?"
"2660240","2663360"," I'm sitting on for our second support right now."
"2663720","2671670"," And then third support is 129.85. Right there."
"2673310","2676070"," And then we can get rid of this for a minute. "
"2676450","2678330"," I've got above."
"2678650","2688090"," We've got 140.59. Did anybody take that trade yesterday?"
"2688090","2688770"," It's a good trade."
"2689910","2691390"," That trade printed this morning. "
"2692270","2698900"," 143.61. Right there."
"2699960","2707380"," And then 145.96. Right there."
"2728110","2728990"," Are two. "
"2737510","2738070"," One."
"2748250","2749510"," But I'm doing those wrong."
"2749970","2751050"," What am I doing here?"
"2751930","2752910"," I'm getting all crazy. "
"2756030","2757870"," I'm over here getting super bearish."
"2757930","2759270"," I'm like, that's our one right there."
"2759370","2759990"," We're going down. "
"2760970","2762390"," There's much love seeing that shit."
"2764730","2766590"," Let's move these where they're supposed to be."
"2779580","2780220"," That's two. "
"2785610","2788570"," And then that's three."
"2797590","2802030"," Let's have a look on the five minute chart on Tesla."
"2813690","2815290"," Oh, is this is this Mike Wilson?"
"2816070","2817350"," See down here buying this stuff?"
"2818590","2823550"," Well, I would think for Tesla today, if you want to know my thoughts on Tesla for the day, the"
"2823550","2831730"," five minute, I'm going to look for some rejection on here and S1 and look for a retest down below"
"2831730","2838210"," of S3 at 129.82. And I'm going to expect it to trade sideways and start to make its way"
"2838210","2838590"," back up. "
"2838770","2840390"," I'm still not giving it a coupon Tesla here."
"2841170","2842830"," I think this is fine to be down here."
"2843550","2846450"," I'm not concerned at all about Tesla being down here. "
"2848710","2849590"," Zero flinching."
"2850190","2852490"," Hopefully you guys watched the video from Spot Gamma."
"2853190","2859750"," People have said that the productivity numbers are something matter in January. "
"2860410","2861710"," I'm not really concerned with that."
"2862230","2866990"," I know there's a swing coming in in Tesla due to how many puts are on the market in January."
"2867710","2872570"," So none of this really concerns me on the macro view or my macro view on Tesla right now. "
"2873210","2875070"," I've got zero concerns with where we are here."
"2878650","2880010"," Put that back up there."
"2884150","2885930"," That's one of the good things I'm going to call spread to. "
"2891380","2892440"," Come back up here."
"2892600","2892940"," Hold on here."
"2893180","2893600"," Come on now. "
"2899520","2901920"," Pinned right off of V-WAP."
"2902020","2903560"," Didn't even get up to the big blue line."
"2904860","2905760"," Came right off. "
"2905920","2910760"," Sold right off a big blue line trying to get down to 378.85. I'm trying to get."
"2911060","2912580"," I'm trying to get out of the house this morning."
"2912760","2914820"," I'm like, man, I want to buy this dip so bad down here. "
"2915220","2916980"," I'm like, now I don't want to go anywhere."
"2917140","2919780"," I want to sit with you guys and pick this up this morning."
"2920480","2921220"," Pick this trade up. "
"2925960","2930000"," I'll see you guys talking about the paid 65."
"2930360","2931020"," Hold me in that capalo."
"2931160","2931420"," No breaks. "
"2931660","2932540"," I had them and closed them."
"2932920","2934280"," It's like one of those runaway truck ramps."
"2934280","2937620"," I'm 25 here, 44 cents from 25 cents. "
"2940500","2942420"," We're going to have to go fashion rugged on a Thursday."
"2942940","2944120"," What's that drop just now?"
"2944820","2946040"," We know when done and I'll clip it."
"2946920","2948420"," Yeah, I think I'm done right now on Tesla. "
"2949420","2952820"," If I had followed my Tesla plan of looking into the trade, I could have snagged a call on that"
"2952820","2957120"," last pop low near 136, then sold to call in there half day."
"2957900","2958840"," I hope that's what I'm checking out."
"2959120","2960160"," Sold to call to create the vertical. "
"2960360","2960920"," That's what that is."
"2960920","2962880"," Oh, our CX getting killed."
"2964400","2965900"," We have the same way about these things too. "
"2966080","2967680"," Can't move long puts on Apple's thoughts."
"2968880","2973540"," Yeah, I think I talked about Apple the other day when I said that you should see."
"2974760","2975900"," Let's look at Apple real quick. "
"2980040","2981360"," Nothing's changed on Apple as well."
"2981940","2982540"," So hold on."
"2984860","2987880"," My ultimate that nothing's changed actually on Tesla either. "
"2987880","2991460"," Tesla, I'm looking for $96, but I don't see it today."
"2991720","2993060"," I don't see it in the end of the year."
"2993380","2994500"," It might be, but I don't see it. "
"2995300","2998540"," I don't think the retracement is done on Tesla and Apple."
"2998700","2999620"," I don't think that it's done either."
"3003340","3006180"," Let's look at Apple on 15 minute chart. "
"3011540","3012180"," Hold on here."
"3015890","3021510"," And where I want to see Apple is somewhere down in this 122 range."
"3023030","3024970"," Anything down here, it'd make me happy as well. "
"3025250","3027330"," $100, $100, $600, $1,117."
"3029370","3030730"," But it's that same kind of a thing."
"3032710","3034130"," I'm going to put this in a five minute chart. "
"3040080","3042600"," I don't know why these things don't."
"3042740","3043840"," This is a box down here."
"3043920","3047520"," I don't know why it's not showing up on this charting down here. "
"3051240","3052560"," This was a box not aligned."
"3052560","3058990"," And it's not showing up on this was a box."
"3059270","3060470"," But I don't know why it's not white. "
"3060910","3062770"," It's like an artifact now or something."
"3064170","3065570"," It was a wider box."
"3070060","3072640"," But even just looking here on the retracement, right?"
"3073000","3074900"," I think this was the 23 here. "
"3075680","3082100"," And I'd still like to see that move down like this."
"3082420","3083880"," And then that move that retracement."
"3084440","3089780"," If you ever get to close this gap or fail to go close this gap, I think that's where your"
"3089780","3092720"," power move comes down into the 120s. "
"3094340","3098700"," Now if we break down below, if we break this new low down here, it might even be sooner."
"3099140","3101860"," If we break the low down here, it'd be sooner."
"3102160","3107520"," But I still think that Apple is going to attempt to close this gap to make a huge move down. "
"3109900","3110880"," One second here."
"3112720","3114560"," Don't think this is the move down here."
"3114960","3119780"," If you think that it is, if you think that this is the move down, what I would do is"
"3119780","3130900"," we'd be looking for a new low and a"
"3130900","3131640"," rejection above. "
"3132840","3136740"," If you think this is it, like Apple's going to do it."
"3137480","3142780"," You'd be looking for a move like this, moving for the move below, rejection, and then just start"
"3142780","3144300"," heading lower, something like that."
"3145480","3146880"," It would be what I'd be looking for. "
"3147700","3152040"," And then my buy below would be somewhere down in here."
"3153100","3154540"," Let's look back and see why."
"3163630","3171350"," Man, this charting is not conducive right now to, hold on a second here. "
"3175250","3177090"," I don't know what the fuck is going on."
"3189760","3191560"," You can see it right down here, right?"
"3191880","3195480"," This is kind of like the last step for Apple."
"3201060","3203040"," Man, I don't know what the fuck is going on with this. "
"3207910","3212990"," I'm having some issues this morning with Apple not."
"3214630","3216830"," So you can start to see the step down in Apple."
"3219530","3222090"," It would be really nice is this break down here. "
"3224870","3227410"," Get down, get down below this level right here."
"3228410","3229750"," You can get down below 100."
"3229910","3232470"," I think that's, I would call this probably 10,000 on. "
"3232870","3233630"," It could be wrong on this."
"3233770","3235330"," I don't think this is 10,000."
"3236330","3238330"," I think this is 10,000 on. "
"3240810","3243930"," I think this, I want to say this is about 10,000 on NASDAQ."
"3243930","3247510"," And then if you start, we start breaking down like that 6,500 level."
"3247950","3249910"," And you get that one bloodbath down below. "
"3250170","3251370"," It's like a $90 level."
"3252650","3257850"," If we get that last capitulation in the market, but we need to implement numbers to get really high"
"3257850","3260110"," for this move down, for this huge move down."
"3260310","3263010"," This could take some time to get through. "
"3263970","3267730"," And my price target on Apple, I think I told Joe last year was, I think 90 bucks."
"3268930","3271110"," I think I said 70 would be tough."
"3272250","3278110"," But I think I gave him $90 for a PT on a year ago. "
"3278410","3283310"," So I want to see 90 or 70 somewhere down in here, race all this nonsense here."
"3284850","3286550"," Come into this back here."
"3289780","3293340"," I don't think Joe said he didn't know if he assumes he would get bought. "
"3293500","3293800"," I do too."
"3294300","3301860"," I think somewhere around that $90 is going to get, it's going to get huge buyers on Apple."
"3304800","3305500"," I'm in here. "
"3308070","3309850"," A better time frame here."
"3313160","3315000"," So when do I take the S-Thou short again?"
"3315840","3316920"," Probably for me."
"3317880","3319740"," I'm not done with this retracement. "
"3319960","3321440"," I want to see the 30th."
"3322480","3325700"," The 30th in here is where I don't care if we're below it."
"3325920","3326960"," I don't care if we're trading right here. "
"3327140","3330280"," I'm not taking that S-Thou until there."
"3330540","3334740"," And then it's only down to the weekly moving average on SPX."
"3334960","3336180"," And then I'll pick that S-Thou. "
"3336620","3339760"," Short up again once you break below the weekly moving average."
"3340900","3346500"," When that weekly moving average on the SPY is one day."
"3351000","3351920"," Hang tight here. "
"3353960","3354680"," One week."
"3358660","3361020"," Let's get rid of all this shit here."
"3363590","3364670"," We'll make this a big red line. "
"3369850","3370790"," Is that where it is?"
"3372030","3373070"," Big of fat and red."
"3376010","3377610"," This is really where it's at right here."
"3379350","3380850"," We can show it on SPX I guess. "
"3382130","3382730"," Show it on SPX."
"3387160","3389020"," This is really what I want to see down here."
"3393800","3399220"," I want to see, so for that S-Thou short, I really want to see S come back up here. "
"3400400","3401280"," And then slam down."
"3402440","3404860"," I think the S-Thou short is from here to here."
"3405820","3411820"," And then I really want to see us break under here and take another S-Thou short and try to"
"3411820","3413640"," get down to the 3100 down here. "
"3413700","3414960"," This is going to be a beautiful trade right here."
"3415800","3418480"," This trade is going to pay bank."
"3420340","3421580"," We need to see some blood. "
"3421720","3424140"," We need to see some bad unemployment numbers to get down here."
"3425400","3426700"," I don't know when this happens."
"3427540","3428800"," I don't know if we slip under. "
"3429600","3431840"," They make another attempt in January and March."
"3432180","3439240"," And then they could trade us sideways into late November of 2023 before we eventually get"
"3439240","3440860"," underneath and finally get some blood."
"3441760","3444380"," But once we're under here, this is going to be a great trade. "
"3445140","3452420"," This is like the January of 22 to July of 22 down move over here."
"3469040","3470120"," It's still bleeding off."
"3470500","3471860"," Spies still bleeding right now. "
"3479380","3481920"," Let's see if we can get this test of S3 down below here."
"3482740","3492620"," We still"
"3492620","3493520"," have sellers right now."
"3493820","3495300"," No hammer candle on spy right now. "
"3504660","3506900"," You guys don't like the idea of Apple at 90 bucks?"
"3507580","3508120"," Is that what we said?"
"3509700","3512880"," Did I say 90 or 72 in Apple?"
"3513340","3513520"," Joe?"
"3516100","3518500"," I don't remember our conversation sometimes."
"3528500","3530640"," I think all in calls down here."
"3530860","3532280"," I think that you wait for a hammer candle. "
"3533580","3534560"," If you want to know."
"3535940","3542560"," And then you trade it up to VWAP or this moving average, this estimated moving average."
"3543340","3545640"," And then you wait for a trade above to pick it up again. "
"3553050","3555430"," I said 90 was likely and 70 was possible."
"3556450","3560470"," My only concern with the 90 is you know they're going to they're going to jump on swords for it."
"3561790","3564210"," Isn't isn't 90 where the last split was to?"
"3565050","3566030"," I can't remember. "
"3569380","3570840"," Yeah, I was calm for that last winter."
"3573300","3574920"," Like I want fucking blood in Apple."
"3580600","3584920"," You start looking at the five minute for a hammer candle and then you're looking for the 15 minute. "
"3586580","3589260"," You'll switch from we'll switch from the five to the 15 minute."
"3589660","3590840"," You want to see some volume."
"3591040","3595480"," You want to see like three to five million on the five minute candle and then about 15 million on"
"3595480","3595660"," the. "
"3597260","3602480"," 15 minute under normal circumstances, but we're so we have solo liquidity right now under the year."
"3603120","3607180"," That you if you see a couple million to like five million on a 15 minute."
"3607540","3608840"," You're probably happy with that. "
"3613210","3614630"," Yeah, I want to see that 90."
"3614630","3616170"," I want to see that gap get closed."
"3616410","3625230"," There was that huge gap on Apple that I want to see that get closed and my lower my lower"
"3625230","3628210"," price targets on Tesla were like ninety six and. "
"3629950","3632210"," Seventy something I don't remember exactly, but."
"3633690","3638210"," The longer that so the longer that Jerome Powell tries to pin the market."
"3638990","3642550"," In the longer time that we spend under the weekly moving average. "
"3643190","3645150"," So if you guys think about time right."
"3646350","3646830"," Historically."
"3648910","3650550"," This is why I don't believe Jerome Powell. "
"3650950","3652210"," I don't believe him at all right now."
"3652390","3654790"," I've got zero faith that he's going to hold rates where they are."
"3656510","3658230"," Now if he does though right. "
"3658410","3661770"," Let's say he holds us under the weekly moving average."
"3663850","3666610"," What happens is the longer we stay under there."
"3667490","3670550"," The intent is to crash the market. "
"3671070","3673970"," So he was calling for a soft landing or a touch and go."
"3674530","3676190"," The longer that he stays under there."
"3677010","3679210"," The the the higher percentage. "
"3680370","3683290"," Chances are that the market crashes to the depths of hell."
"3684050","3685930"," So if they try to crash it, let's say."
"3687090","3690590"," In January or March or November of next year. "
"3690590","3693530"," And if we're if we're just keep staying under that weekly moving average."
"3694230","3697650"," You'll end up seeing real real low numbers on the aspects."
"3697710","3700110"," You won't see 12 P.E.s. You'll see. "
"3701250","3702630"," Eight and tens and sixes."
"3703390","3704050"," Like real real low."
"3704250","3704690"," Low shit. "
"3705710","3709170"," And so I think that's the bond market is saying right now is not think."
"3709390","3711170"," But that's what the bond market is saying is."
"3712690","3714130"," Well, the feds lying to you. "
"3714850","3717750"," The bond market saying that something will happen."
"3717750","3718770"," You'll get some kind of."
"3719150","3723250"," I don't know the Ukraine war is over or you'll get something that'll rip the market up. "
"3724930","3728710"," And then we'll trade it back down so that the bottom is only like 3100."
"3729590","3731250"," Now, if they don't do that, right?"
"3731850","3733290"," If they continue on their path."
"3734430","3736050"," Your soft landing is out the window. "
"3736350","3737350"," You'll end up seeing like."
"3738490","3741810"," You know, 26 24 possibly 16 or 1400."
"3743010","3744690"," So even calling so the Tesla. "
"3745430","3749710"," I was thinking I was calling for Tesla for like 96 maybe a low of 70s or 60s or something."
"3750790","3754250"," But if they if they continue that path, you're not going to see those numbers."
"3754270","3757230"," You're going to see Tesla in the 20s. "
"3757730","3758670"," Something like that."
"3759370","3762030"," You'll see Apple way below 70."
"3763510","3765170"," You'll see you'll see market destruction. "
"3766430","3768010"," You definitely will see it."
"3776970","3781710"," No, so so consensus on rates is not longer."
"3783850","3785550"," There's it's really funny. "
"3785770","3786390"," There's a lot of."
"3787450","3791750"," There's a lot of false narrative in the market right now, which is hilarious."
"3794930","3799230"," Crazy part is they're saying that the market believes that there'll be a pause. "
"3800130","3803050"," And that the market believes that we're going up."
"3803330","3804550"," I hear all these different narratives."
"3804970","3805510"," They're being spun. "
"3810350","3811150"," And so the market."
"3811350","3812950"," So it's not the market doesn't believe any of this."
"3813810","3815470"," The bond market believes it. "
"3815950","3818130"," So we have to clarify the truth is."
"3819010","3822290"," That the bond market does not believe the fed."
"3824930","3826890"," Now there are some problems. "
"3827490","3828770"," You need to see unemployment."
"3830170","3835710"," New unemployment claims like unemployment claims start to start to rise in the bond market saying"
"3835710","3836950"," two other things."
"3838370","3843090"," The bond market saying that inflation is going to come down rapidly like we're talking like"
"3843090","3844250"," January, February, March. "
"3844870","3847250"," June, July would be like 2%."
"3847250","3848750"," That's very fast."
"3850110","3856690"," And they're also claiming the bond market that unemployment rate is going to skyrocket like like"
"3856690","3857790"," rocket ship up. "
"3858730","3861570"," So we haven't seen that yet, but they're claiming that."
"3861950","3866310"," So what they're what they're telling you is what the bond market is telling you is the fed is not"
"3866310","3867110"," going to raise rates."
"3867110","3867870"," They're going to pause. "
"3867990","3873770"," They're likely even going to go to a neutral stance sooner than you think we could begin to happen"
"3873770","3875110"," this last meeting."
"3875110","3883570"," Now he is interesting because when you watch that last meeting, you could visibly see him upset"
"3883570","3889490"," that the bond market now they're trying to pawn this off on stock market or retail traders."
"3889750","3895290"," This has nothing to do with retail traders has nothing to do with the market, the cash market. "
"3895990","3900310"," This is the bond market pricing in that we're not going to go there."
"3900930","3904550"," And mostly because of the verbiage that Jerome Powell is using."
"3905010","3906230"," Jerome Powell is still using. "
"3907110","3908490"," We're going to have a soft landing."
"3911310","3917190"," And you can't have a soft landing with his path is the point that they're making."
"3917710","3919550"," You can see it in the yield curve coming up. "
"3919550","3921830"," You can see it in inflation coming down."
"3922550","3927310"," You can somewhat see it in unemployment right now, although there seem to be padding the numbers in"
"3927310","3928950"," unemployment, which is kind of funny too."
"3930630","3934310"," So there's a narrative that they're trying to push right now, which is kind of bizarre. "
"3938830","3944770"," My thought process was that they might be pushing this narrative currently to make the stock market"
"3944770","3946250"," believe that they're doing their job."
"3947170","3949250"," So that the stock market would actually rise."
"3950650","3954850"," The stock market can rise if he maintains course. "
"3955710","3958490"," And then that would be the crash that doesn't go that deep."
"3959250","3960730"," We haven't seen that yet either."
"3960910","3963930"," We'll know more about that as we come into the weekly moving average. "
"3964450","3967090"," That will actually be the tell or should be the tell."
"3969130","3973250"," So there's a lot of moving parts to see what he's doing."
"3973970","3980090"," I think is my thought process is that his intent is to seem like he's doing what needs to be"
"3980090","3980270"," done. "
"3980930","3983150"," And then he's waiting to see what the reaction is."
"3983910","3990670"," If the if the if the bond market believes him and the stock market trades sideways and up until we"
"3990670","3993590"," have a crash, which we've done in previous years."
"3993730","3995630"," We've done that in the 60s and then the 70s. "
"3995850","4001950"," The only two modern examples where we haven't done that is 2000 2001 and 2007 2008."
"4002350","4003790"," And that's where we went under both times."
"4003790","4007770"," We went under the weekly moving average and then we did not have a soft landing. "
"4008530","4010390"," We had a very hard landing."
"4011570","4020250"," But there are many examples in the 80s and the 90s in the mid 2000s, late 2000s where we did"
"4020250","4021530"," not, we did have a soft landing."
"4022070","4025390"," So the bond market's economy, economy liar. "
"4026690","4032190"," And not only the bond market, the swap market is currency markets are not just the bond market, but"
"4032190","4033690"," currency markets economy liar."

"4077900","4082240"," And they're not going to lower their prices for you ever."
"4082600","4083680"," They don't care what you think. "
"4083680","4089380"," So if you were paying for a dollar, a dollar pound for ground beef 20 years ago, and 10 years"
"4089380","4090920"," ago, you're paying two dollars a pound."
"4091480","4096000"," And then recently you're paying three dollars, then right now you're paying, you know, four dollars"
"4096000","4097359"," a pound or five dollars a pound."
"4097700","4101500"," They're going to try to hold that price on you because they build their business models around"
"4101500","4105380"," that, around that opportunity to raise prices. "

"4159180","4162380"," I don't know its thoughts, but very complex ideas. "
"4163260","4163960"," They try to simplify."
"4164819","4167020"," So I'm going to recommend to you to go down the rabbit hole."
"4168399","4172220"," Watch, I don't know, the last 10 or 20 videos, whatever you want to watch. "
"4173920","4179800"," And I wouldn't watch them to say this is my view on the stock market, but I would watch them"
"4179800","4180100"," videos."

"4206680","4210100"," a bear like, you know, you name him, Northman Trader."
"4210700","4213440"," He's like a bear like that guy, uber bear."
"4214300","4218300"," And I believe, or I'm somewhat in the same camp as that guy. "
"4219080","4226620"," So if you're disagreeing with me on what I'm saying, right, I can assure you that if you're a bear"
"4226620","4231560"," that if you knew this stuff, you'd be like, oh, yeah, I understand exactly what he's saying."

"5335900","5337140"," This is two days ago. "
"5338000","5338780"," We'll go back to."
"5344310","5351390"," You can see that previous low is right down here at three seventy eight eighty six."
"5353730","5355410"," Bears want to break that at least. "
"5357130","5358070"," If they can."
"5358730","5362230"," And then we've got another previous low here and we've got this range."
"5363130","5364870"," Down here that we've been trading since. "
"5370480","5373000"," Since when is this the 19th?"

"5383600","5385800"," And then we have a previous low on."
"5387740","5391820"," The 20th the open three seventy seven seventy eight."
"5394180","5398200"," And then of course we've got the repetitive lows down here. "
"5404070","5407230"," So the algorithms are going to want to touch at least this one here."
"5407870","5409250"," Please this one right here."
"5409330","5410250"," So we'll see if they can touch it. "

"5971930","5973610"," He's told stories about that too, right?"
"5973710","5974690"," I've always been upside down. "
"5974970","5976630"," Six figures in trades."

"6019690","6022090"," I think it's I think it's Twitter handles the real mystery and."
"6024030","6025030"," I could be wrong on that."

"6026470","6027370"," They're out the real mystery and."
"6028210","6030350"," But I think he's the real the real mystery and."
"6033650","6034810"," Oh, you remember that, Steven?"

"6041010","6043010"," His earnings season rant was fucking awesome."
"6043750","6045470"," He went on a huge tirade. "
"6045930","6046330"," Huge."
"6046330","6047730"," And it came back."
"6048830","6052030"," So it started dumping hard, but then it actually came back. "
"6052170","6053110"," So he was actually right."
"6053910","6055150"," He was actually right."
"6055250","6056430"," He was actually correct in the. "
"6056650","6058710"," If you over like that course of six weeks or whatever."
"6062550","6063830"," He did get rid of Twitter."
"6064030","6064910"," There's someone calling him. "
"6065170","6068690"," There's somebody out there calling themselves mystery and I'm like, that's not Mr Yen."
"6071210","6073010"," I wonder if I have his email any longer."
"6076610","6079110"," Every once in a while, I'll post something about him on Twitter. "
"6080190","6083710"," I'll do like a goat Jeff or something and give him a shout out."
"6086010","6087370"," Like homage to him."
"6101810","6102950"," No, I think so. "
"6103930","6105630"," So you guys know his algorithm is right."
"6105810","6106170"," There's computers."
"6107390","6109910"," They want to touch this little yellow line right here. "
"6110010","6111030"," You see this little yellow line."
"6112290","6114430"," They want to touch this little yellow line right here."
"6114430","6116790"," So the blue algorithms want to come down here, right?"
"6117090","6118190"," And they want to just touch it. "
"6119370","6123530"," And break it slightly like little peepy mark right over it right here."
"6124110","6126410"," So they can tell you that they were coming back down here eventually."
"6127930","6128830"," That's all they want to do. "
"6128930","6130390"," They want to touch it with their peepy right down here."
"6131170","6132150"," And break it right there."
"6133610","6135850"," It's just it's just it's not really humans. "
"6136190","6139450"," It's just a computer algorithm that wants to get through this line right here."
"6141170","6142570"," I just want to touch it."
"6148110","6150190"," Yeah, remember the goat Jeff that I did where he was smoking?"
"6150710","6152010"," Do you remember the goat Jeff that I did?"
"6152130","6155430"," We were smoking like cigarettes or some shit in India. "
"6155450","6157690"," And I was like, Mr. Jens the greatest of all time."
"6163430","6164970"," There's a little peepy down here."
"6165130","6166130"," There's a little tiny peepy. "
"6166550","6168030"," I'll put it on the one minute so you can see it."
"6168390","6168890"," Same touch it."
"6169450","6170990"," This is usually like a computer program. "
"6171150","6171610"," They're down here."
"6172290","6174110"," A little computer program wants to touch."
"6175910","6177590"," This little mark right here. "
"6178030","6179830"," This little piggy right here he wants to touch."
"6180490","6182010"," He wants to touch it real bad."
"6182790","6183730"," Real, real bad. "
"6184550","6185650"," And a bear wants to touch it too."
"6185810","6188850"," Bear wants to see this previous little get broken."
"6189370","6190310"," Even if we shoot back up. "
"6190790","6191710"," It just wants to touch it."
"6194130","6196190"," And then of course when you're making a bottom."
"6197650","6198790"," What are you looking for right?"
"6198990","6199910"," You're looking for the first bounce. "
"6202690","6205110"," The second bounce and maybe even a third bounce."
"6205990","6206350"," One."
"6206730","6207090"," Two. "
"6208570","6209570"," And you go up."
"6214960","6216360"," So we'll see if we get the two bounces."
"6216500","6218180"," We'll see if we get the peepy touch down below. "
"6223640","6225000"," Some of you are all really bearish."
"6225060","6226500"," We're going to do that peepy touch."
"6226700","6227460"," Then we're going to break down. "
"6229940","6231820"," We're going to go to the depths of hell cap."
"6232340","6233420"," We're not doing no peepy touch."
"6233920","6235080"," Don't touch my peepy cap. "
"6235280","6235740"," I like that."
"6239100","6241360"," So we'll see if we get that peepy touch down here."
"6251280","6253040"," Keep our eyes on down here. "
"6253340","6255920"," So we get these algorithms, these computers down here to get a print."
"6262180","6264740"," It is showing lower lows down here."
"6264860","6265660"," If you look down here below. "
"6269860","6271960"," There is some staircase going on down here."
"6274520","6275300"," So there they go."
"6275340","6276160"," They just broke it finally. "
"6276640","6279380"," There is some stair casing for this stuff down here."
"6279500","6280140"," These previous lows."
"6281520","6282660"," So be wary of that. "
"6282780","6283740"," You can see it on book map."
"6284040","6285040"," You can see how my cursor is."
"6285160","6285540"," That's a."
"6286800","6288660"," So we'll put those in just in case. "
"6291270","6291910"," There you go."
"6291910","6293370"," They just broke the previous low."
"6294010","6295610"," So the robots are happy. "
"6297090","6299290"," There is this little bit down here."
"6299750","6302310"," This is you can see where my cursor is on book map."
"6303930","6305730"," They could staircase this down here. "
"6309190","6311150"," I'm looking more for the reaction trade though."
"6312270","6313170"," Make that one red."
"6315310","6317130"," If you think we're going down here. "
"6317830","6319050"," You're going to be looking for."
"6319910","6321570"," So we did this previous low."
"6322570","6324410"," You're still looking for this trade higher. "
"6325150","6327790"," And if it gets rejected, this would be your first one."
"6327990","6329090"," And that would be your second one."
"6332910","6334570"," So we can we'll set that trade up. "
"6338720","6341780"," And we see if we can look at it from a better perspective."
"6346840","6348740"," If you're still super bearish here."
"6351240","6352560"," We can start right here. "
"6352760","6352980"," We'll skip."
"6353180","6354260"," We'll just get bearish."
"6355080","6355740"," Hold on. "
"6362420","6363440"," If you want to see that."
"6363700","6365340"," If you want to see that that happened."
"6383710","6389620"," You can kind of see it right there. "
"6389760","6391680"," You can kind of see it right below down here."
"6394560","6396500"," If they start staircase on us, you'll know it."
"6414240","6415180"," I'm kind of happy. "
"6415660","6418540"," I'm flat now on the on the water trade that I had."
"6419880","6422680"," Like the to the lot of paid for itself this morning."
"6422760","6424060"," So I'm very happy. "
"6432010","6433670"," If you're if you want to get bullish."
"6435970","6437330"," You want to see."
"6439070","6442290"," Well, you can trade this stuff here, but if you want to get actual bullish. "
"6443350","6444430"," On the inter day."
"6446770","6447390"," You want to see."
"6453060","6454120"," This happened here. "
"6456700","6460360"," Or, you know, like consolidation here and then, you know, run up."
"6461900","6462760"," Something like this."
"6466460","6468220"," If you see a rejection here. "
"6470240","6473320"," Or if you see this view up come up and you see a rejection here."
"6474540","6476240"," You're going to look for a new load down below."
"6476800","6478380"," And then this new low down here. "
"6480340","6482960"," Would not surprise me to see some consolidation in here."
"6484120","6485820"," This is the no man's land in here."
"6487440","6490100"," Right, you know, we talk about no man's land all the time. "
"6490920","6492080"," Where the no man's land is."
"6502930","6503890"," Yeah, it's decent volume."
"6504430","6505410"," I took this trade right here. "
"6506430","6507190"," I made made a fast."
"6507490","6509210"," I think it made 10 or 13% or something."
"6531280","6532760"," Where are these calls right here?"
"6532880","6533540"," Three eighties. "
"6535020","6537320"," Those are eighty three cents to get right here."
"6539760","6541640"," I like the forty eight cent calls."
"6545250","6545970"," The third. "
"6546170","6548910"," So the forty eight cent three eighty ones are twenty seven deltas."
"6550910","6552170"," That's a good trade right here."
"6552210","6552910"," Forty eight cents. "
"6559640","6560960"," Yeah, so you know what?"
"6560960","6563220"," Winky, I wasn't able to watch the video."
"6563500","6565520"," Can you give us a synopsis in chat?"
"6565880","6567220"," Was what he was saying to buy?"
"6568880","6570960"," What sectors was he saying to buy here?"
"6573560","6574420"," What did he say?"
"6574540","6575620"," Give us this if you can."
"6580080","6580660"," Oh, yeah. "
"6580840","6581320"," Winky, baby."
"6581760","6582940"," Winky, those out of my bottoms."
"6583080","6583460"," He's learning. "
"6589690","6592270"," Winky, how can you give us this synopsis when he said?"
"6597600","6598740"," He just said, buy, spy."
"6599760","6600980"," Did he give a date?"
"6605380","6607680"," He said, just by SPX or spy or yes."
"6632140","6633280"," What did he say, Winky?"
"6642430","6643730"," Yeah, I'm looking to buy it. "
"6643850","6645110"," I'm looking to buy Christmas."
"6645810","6647690"," Three eighty four C's right now."
"6648510","6649690"," They're fifty two cents. "
"6650350","6650950"," I want them bad."
"6657490","6657970"," Yeah."
"6669840","6670680"," Hold on here. "
"6671880","6672340"," Tesla."
"6675640","6676600"," Tesla, baby."
"6677720","6678720"," Broke all support. "
"6683740","6684840"," Tesla, bloodbath."
"6685620","6688900"," We said one, what do we say you're saying, Winky, four of the puts on Tesla?"
"6690180","6691640"," What was the exact put strike on Tesla?"
"6692520","6694060"," Those must have printed fucking fat, huh?"
"6695840","6696520"," What did he say?"
"6696660","6698840"," It was somewhat convoluted because he also gave a stop."
"6699020","6700840"," And next he said, buy, even if he's just today. "
"6701400","6702880"," Some of the next first green day."
"6703440","6704460"," And it has a hundred percent rent rate."
"6704620","6707600"," I'll set an eighteen hundred dollar stop. "
"6707880","6710380"," The live SP stock market show, remember how I said Tesla 120."
"6710740","6712460"," Yeah, everything called 128 yesterday."
"6714220","6719700"," Yeah, we made a trade yesterday for a call spread with the 128 P's or something. "
"6720480","6721240"," They were dirt cheap."
"6721440","6722680"," They're like twenty eight cents or something."
"6725260","6726640"," They were 125 P's. "
"6727340","6727780"," What are they?"
"6727880","6728700"," What are they at right now?"
"6745740","6749940"," So 125, they're a dollar fifty one right now."
"6750940","6751960"," Dollar fifty one."
"6752120","6753040"," That's fucking crazy. "
"6761360","6762760"," They got as high as 192."
"6765420","6767900"," So at least you know how to hedge a trade now, right?"
"6773440","6775720"," The 125 P went over two hundred percent."
"6776020","6777380"," It went over higher than that, didn't it?"
"6777380","6780220"," I had those puts for like twenty thirty cents. "
"6782200","6784280"," I think they went like eight hundred percent or something."
"6785380","6786120"," They could be wrong."
"6792240","6794140"," They were like throw away puts just in case. "
"6800240","6804120"," And then we said yesterday to cut the call side loose of the put spread or the call spread and"
"6804120","6806240"," hang on to the puts if we broke below, right?"
"6806980","6810820"," So it had broken the queue had sold the calls on the opening bell and then just kept cranking on"
"6810820","6811420"," the put side."
"6813720","6815080"," And they were thirty cents yesterday."
"6822090","6828150"," And you still have the puts on the or you still have the calls sold on the on the on"
"6828150","6829070"," the call spread too. "
"6830270","6831510"," So that would crank as well."
"6842500","6845100"," Because you're buying a call and selling a call, right?"
"6845720","6846300"," On that trade."
"6847660","6849180"," Buy a call, selling a call and buying a put. "
"6850380","6851440"," I think that's the trade."
"6853280","6855520"," Buy a call, selling a call and buying a put."
"6860010","6860690"," On Tesla. "
"6864530","6865490"," Bloodbath down here."
"6867810","6868250"," Bloodbath."
"6875180","6876060"," Total bloodbath. "
"6876860","6878780"," Spy is trying to revisit the blows down here."
"6885460","6885900"," Consolidation."
"6887020","6887800"," I haven't entered a trade here. "
"6887960","6889160"," I took one trade down here."
"6889240","6889980"," I haven't entered anything yet."
"6890520","6891560"," I'm looking at some. "
"6891740","6894340"," I want to watch that Larry Williams video."
"6895680","6898560"," You know, it's weird with Larry Williams videos when he does this shit is he."
"6900240","6904520"," He gives you like this video and he's like buy the low of the day. "
"6906260","6909260"," He's like he's like when he makes those videos, he's like."
"6910240","6915140"," He'll like to a video and be like on on December 27th."
"6916000","6917400"," On the low of the day. "
"6918380","6923380"," I want you to buy SPX spy or yes for every do or I usually says yes, I think."
"6924420","6924980"," I don't know."
"6925040","6925860"," Maybe he says SPX. "
"6926000","6928100"," Then he goes, he goes, I want you to hold it."
"6929280","6931060"," Until you get a hundred percent print."
"6931520","6934820"," And so the last time he did that, we and Winky were like. "
"6935560","6936700"," It was a day just like today."
"6936960","6938920"," We were like behind buying that fucking shit."
"6939160","6939500"," Fuck him. "
"6940380","6941720"," And Winky, I think agreed."
"6943100","6947340"," It looked like the depths of hell and then sure enough, like it just fucking went."
"6947400","6948080"," North. "
"6950460","6951180"," Rocket ship."
"6951800","6960000"," Oh, you did buy it, Winky."
"6961200","6962780"," He did buy that trade last time. "
"6963000","6963540"," I didn't believe him."
"6963680","6965140"," Maybe it was me that just didn't believe him."
"6965880","6968880"," I was like a fucking following that trade and he was a hundred percent right though. "
"6971840","6973700"," He has trades or his trades are bad ass."
"6974980","6976640"," His trades are one hundred percent bad ass."
"6976740","6978160"," We just broke S3 now. "
"6978160","6981640"," We broke the previous slow and S3 at 37866."
"6987710","6989730"," Yeah, his trades aren't easy to take."
"6990810","6992730"," His trades are not easy to take. "
"6997800","7003540"," His trades are like like hair on your chest, sweating in your seat."
"7004940","7006760"," He's always like exact on him."
"7006800","7009480"," He's like on March 3rd. "
"7010020","7014240"," The lower the day on March 3rd, June 15th at the high."
"7015480","7021820"," Because he goes back and he looks historically and he's like, you know, in this date, it's a"
"7021820","7025580"," hundred percent trade since the history of the stock market began."
"7026340","7028640"," And so he throws that shit out at you and you're like, what?"
"7032900","7033780"," I don't know. "
"7033800","7035900"," I don't know what he does to find that shit, but."
"7042920","7044640"," Yeah, he doesn't make a bunch of videos."
"7048340","7049940"," I've got a stock charts account. "
"7049940","7054260"," I emailed him and was like, I was like, I'll suck your dick."
"7057140","7063560"," I was like, he does."
"7063760","7064560"," He uses all the data. "
"7064740","7066640"," He's a very data driven trader."
"7073220","7074740"," Please like and subscribe these videos."
"7076900","7081980"," If you find them useful and helpful, what's going on in the one minute?"
"7082020","7082920"," I can't see shit here. "
"7083960","7086040"," I want to check out the woman here and see."
"7086040","7087940"," We just consolidating down here as that we're doing."
"7090040","7090920"," Just consolidating. "
"7095500","7096260"," Hold on here."
"7120870","7123290"," Man, they're really juice and spy calls here too."
"7123470","7123770"," I don't want them. "
"7126120","7133460"," We got 30 delta call right now and spy as $1.23. Fuck that, dude, for today's expiry."
"7134820","7135740"," I fucking hate dealers."
"7138660","7140360"," Sometimes I fucking hate dealers. "
"7144960","7145920"," I'll be honest."
"7150440","7154820"," Our market makers should say dealers to market makers."
"7157880","7168600"," I'm going to buy this for $1.30 for $1.28. I"
"7168600","7172400"," can just go to take Christmas expiry. "
"7172800","7177740"," Did he give a timeframe on that trade by chance, Winky?"
"7189350","7197760"," Did he give the bullish here, bro?"
"7224260","7225620"," I'm going up a little bit here."
"7226320","7230760"," A little bit of volume in the market down here."
"7240180","7241400"," I'm long here, by the way. "
"7246490","7249670"," If you're just joining us for the first time, you can always go down to the..."
"7250730","7257930"," If you want to listen to us in real time, you can go down to the cogwheel in YouTube for"
"7257930","7258250"," settings."
"7259390","7261950"," Click on it and then you click on playback speed."
"7263190","7266450"," Then click 2.5 times or two times or whatever it offers you. "
"7266890","7268270"," My voice will begin to sound weird."
"7270330","7280290"," Because natively YouTube will delay the live stream by up to 13 to 15 seconds."
"7281410","7291410"," If you speed up playback, there will be a weird voice for a half a minute"
"7291410","7291810"," or so. "
"7292030","7294730"," Then you'll be delayed by about 3 to 5 seconds."
"7295430","7299370"," Unless you have slow internet, then that delay would be on your end."
"7306960","7309060"," Let's see if we'll get a little turnaround here or not. "
"7310380","7311240"," We'll have some stops."
"7320030","7324090"," Let's see if the one minute holds up here or not."
"7326810","7331230"," We'll have the one minute at the moment to see if we can trade at least up into VWAP right"
"7331230","7331470"," now. "
"7333150","7335650"," If you don't know what stops are, you can hand."
"7335650","7337870"," You can just hand do stops if you want."
"7338070","7342370"," You want to keep them below somewhere down here. "
"7343670","7350170"," Whatever your risk tolerance is."
"7352290","7354210"," Sometimes you're going to put a grab down below here."
"7354450","7355690"," Sometimes some people want more risk. "
"7355910","7356750"," They want to put it down here."
"7360680","7363300"," They'll seek out stops below as well."
"7366400","7370480"," If you're not going to set a stop, at least have a risk tolerance for where your will and take"
"7370480","7371320"," losses down here. "
"7373020","7376400"," If you're not picking the right direction for your trade, you want to get out of it."
"7376620","7378860"," Your trade should be going in the direction that you're wanting it to go."
"7381600","7384920"," You shouldn't be entering a trade if this continues lower here. "
"7385640","7387700"," You shouldn't be chasing your trade down lower here."
"7387820","7389580"," You should be trying to chase the trade up."
"7405860","7409620"," Or down, whatever direction you're taking, taking puts, taking calls, doesn't matter. "
"7419260","7425520"," There's still some stair casing here going on."
"7447080","7450100"," Yeah, I've got some, my stops are down here."
"7471620","7473020"," Let me make sure I get the news on for you. "
"7475570","7478050"," I'll read some news off to where I'll wait and see what happens here."

"7525930","7526910"," They produce this every year. "
"7529390","7532890"," Stuff like that, it wouldn't shock me from the comeback of middle of the night and be like, well,"

"7536310","7537170"," It's going to take another day."
"7538870","7542710"," They always threaten that they'll come back and deal with it after the holidays. "
"7544130","7545190"," And then they go home for their holidays."
"7545830","7550590"," They have a fake government shutdown over New Year and then eventually gets passed."
"7551830","7552610"," It's like this. "
"7552750","7555450"," It's all like a pomp and circumstance theater."
"7556410","7562050"," Meanwhile, behind the scenes, both parties are trying to fatten themselves upright."
"7562330","7563470"," This is both sides of the aisle. "
"7563630","7564410"," It doesn't matter who it is."
"7572950","7574270"," Good day, Ken Ross."
"7574490","7574690"," How are you?"
"7577390","7580630"," Chase Winter spending bill, maybe time to long pork. "
"7581330","7583450"," Oh, that's almost like a triple."
"7584310","7585530"," Chase, that's like a triple."
"7586930","7588430"," A triple joke, right?"
"7588710","7590430"," Because long pork is human, right?"
"7590610","7591370"," Isn't that, isn't that human?"
"7596090","7599830"," That's some shit like my, that's a joke that my dad would tell me. "
"7600070","7601750"," Did you get the part about humans in there?"
"7605250","7605650"," Yeah."
"7616510","7618310"," It's showing how current down right on Ross."
"7618930","7621490"," What are you doing for a, what are you doing for Christmas?"
"7622390","7625890"," Are you getting the snow, blizzard, wind, rain, ice?"
"7626210","7630530"," Putin says the gas price cap will not lead to anything good in the gas sector. "
"7631110","7632670"," Same goes for the oil price cap."
"7637230","7639810"," Ross, are you, are you, are you being impacted by this?"
"7639970","7645610"," Ben Godfrey earlier said it was already like minus 1000 in, in, uh, in Montana."
"7649390","7650370"," Yeah, we're getting that. "
"7650650","7652310"," I, I didn't know it was going to be that bad."
"7653370","7655490"," And, uh, I didn't know it was going to be that bad."
"7655810","7658430"," And of course my wife's talking to me earlier this morning. "
"7658430","7659310"," We're sitting in bed and."
"7660210","7664290"," Uh, so it's going to rain here and then drop like 30 degrees."
"7665130","7667150"," So I don't know what the fuck is going on. "
"7671470","7675110"," Yeah, my, my head, I had a buddy in Colorado comment on that last night."
"7676350","7677850"," Said it went down to Colorado."
"7678210","7679970"," Just, uh, it was like a fast drop. "
"7685110","7687490"," Yeah, it says the car prices are way overpriced right now."
"7687490","7688310"," I, I can't do it."
"7688370","7689270"," I was looking at it right now. "
"7689310","7691630"," I'm like, I'm like, fuck no."
"7698710","7700350"," Minus 29 wind chill right now."
"7702090","7702690"," That's brutal. "
"7707330","7708970"," Are they taking us around down here?"
"7709630","7713890"," I don't like sitting down here this long at 11 30 a.m. Eastern time."
"7714090","7717050"," The US sells $45 billion in four week bills."
"7717530","7722930"," Private cover of three to 16 and a prior high yield of three spots, 78%. "
"7726790","7729890"," No, I just, I always like to buy stuff cheap."
"7730450","7733590"," I don't like to buy like, I like buying overpriced shit."
"7735050","7739490"," Um, you know, I could, so it, it, it pads my numbers, right?"
"7739490","7745810"," So if I'm buying a call that's a dollar, uh, I needed to print what?"
"7746350","7748290"," Pre two, three, four dollars. "
"7749490","7752470"," Um, if I make that mistake, it's a pretty big mistake, right?"
"7752790","7755190"," If I buy four 25 cent calls."
"7756870","7762350"," I have Putin says we reserved the right to consider whether we are obliged to fill the gas"
"7762350","7762610"," contracts."
"7762610","7764550"," If other parties violate them. "
"7764550","7768830"," Um, there's like premium already built into those calls."
"7769090","7771250"," This is specific to like zero dates in the spy."
"7772190","7778050"," But if you're watching like, um, if you're watching Tesla, you should be watching their call chain"
"7778050","7778610"," all day long. "
"7778610","7786610"," If there, you can go on to think or swim and you'll see, um, you know, you'll see like, uh,"
"7786810","7787790"," the life of a call."
"7787890","7790790"," You just watch it all day long and I say this all the time, right?"
"7790790","7795850"," So if you're, if you're watching a call or a put, I don't care what it is."
"7796890","7800310"," Um, it has a life to it, right?"
"7801870","7804230"," And it'll go like this and it's pricing. "
"7806690","7807910"," It's going to zero, right?"
"7808590","7809290"," It's at its death."
"7810610","7814230"," And you'll see when they're expensive and when they're cheap and when they're expensive and when"
"7814230","7816850"," they're cheap and when they're expensive and when they're expensive and they're cheap, they're"
"7816850","7818070"," expensive and they're cheap."
"7819530","7821890"," So you want to be buying them cheap and not high. "
"7823590","7824810"," Cheap, not high."
"7825710","7830010"," And even if let's say we don't get up there and it just rolls over, at least you had a"
"7830010","7831630"," better chance of buying down here."
"7831650","7833430"," If you bought it one, two, three or four times. "
"7834470","7839910"," Then if you were constantly buying high calls, basically this is the trade you're expecting, right?"
"7840050","7843050"," When you're buying high, you're going to trade out of that range."
"7843970","7848070"," So oftentimes when you're like, sometimes it was like a thousand dollars."
"7848070","7852570"," And you're like, I'll see with traders where they'll get one or two great trades and it'll blast"
"7852570","7857210"," off and it'll trade out of its normal price range and applied move. "
"7858830","7861030"," And you'll be like, whoo, I'm amazing."
"7862710","7872550"," But if you want a better win rate, it's typically watching the natural or destruction of that call"
"7872550","7873670"," or that put."
"7873670","7876890"," So that's just a baseline. "
"7878730","7883070"," And then on top of all that, there's things, there's other things that happen."
"7883290","7884330"," Like you see this right here, right?"
"7884950","7888870"," So this is re-pricing of options right here, starting to grind options and stuff."
"7889010","7889890"," So you'll see that going on. "
"7891030","7893110"," You're looking for premium kick in options."
"7893890","7897610"," There's all kinds of different things you're looking for when you."
"7900370","7902170"," When you're entering calls or puts. "
"7903750","7907170"," So just a general baseline rule, buy them cheap, sell them high."
"7907730","7908650"," Buy low sell high."
"7911070","7913690"," And those Tesla calls just taking a peek at them. "
"7913710","7914910"," I was like, man, they're so fucking expensive."
"7916730","7922630"," Like, I don't want to fuel another trip down on fucking, I'm not fuel another trip down on a bad"
"7922630","7924050"," trade for Tesla."
"7927810","7933770"," Even the trade yesterday was a call spread in case it does come back up with huge hedge on it. "
"7934450","7936470"," Cheap puts because the puts were so dirt cheap."
"7938150","7939230"," They're just pennies."
"7940350","7944910"," Not pennies, but you know, 30 cents, 20 cents, something like that, real cheap hedge. "
"7948690","7950390"," So I don't know, if you think we're going."
"7950430","7950930"," One minute remaining."
"7951370","7952590"," I'll lead with the bid to cover ratio. "
"7953150","7954070"," You're going down here."
"7954590","7959850"," If you're like long puts in the hair or selling calls down here, you'd still want a cheap call"
"7959850","7961410"," hedge outside the money above."
"7962830","7965970"," To protect your, your we're going down right further. "
"7968890","7972170"," You know, if you buy, let's see, buy some puts here that cost you."
"7972990","7973950"," I don't fucking know."
"7974090","7977350"," They cost you a dollar and you're like, it's going to print two dollars. "
"7977990","7984190"," Well, you get paid 80 cents and buy a 20 cent call to hedge that trade."
"7985070","7990830"," So if it goes against you, you'll least make the money back from the trade that you initially want"
"7990830","7991330"," to take."
"7993590","7995330"," This goes both ways bear bull. "
"7995550","7995870"," Doesn't matter."
"7996070","7996350"," Theta."
"8000110","8002590"," Surely expecting the four week bills auction. "
"8006730","8008170"," They still in what?"
"8008670","8010070"," No, I sold those up here."
"8010790","8011570"," I took that trade."
"8013530","8015590"," I think I traded that here to here. "
"8016890","8020330"," And then I just entered down here or down here somewhere."
"8020810","8021050"," I entered."
"8023230","8025010"," Sitting in three eighty one C's. "
"8026330","8028790"," Looking for a trip higher to be wop."
"8030770","8032110"," I'm going to stop down here."
"8034390","8036550"," So right now I'm in three to one C's. "
"8036610","8037610"," I'm going to stop right here."
"8037970","8039170"," My price target is above here."
"8039930","8041330"," I want to see this move higher. "
"8042230","8043650"," I'll get out of this trade."
"8045110","8046170"," As we approach it."
"8047130","8049890"," And then I'll look to pick it back up on a five minute chart. "
"8051470","8052230"," Right up here."
"8052350","8052770"," You can see it."
"8056170","8058110"," So I'm going to actually get out of that trade right here. "
"8058150","8059050"," Three right at three eighty."
"8059070","8059990"," I'll try to get out of that trade."
"8062070","8064390"," And I'll pick it back up probably from here to here. "
"8064970","8069030"," And if the big blue line starts to turn around, I will."
"8070290","8074150"," If this big blue line, if we get above this big blue line, I'm going to get bullish."
"8077270","8079290"," And then I'll pick that trade back up again. "
"8079550","8083090"," If we get up here and do something like this, I would pick that trade back up for a big"
"8083090","8083510"," move higher."
"8088970","8090290"," Trade the levels every time."
"8091710","8092550"," Trade the levels. "
"8092870","8093390"," Well, not every time."
"8093390","8095470"," On like a one to three month trade, no trade levels."
"8095970","8099390"," If it's directionally where I think we're going, you have to have some patience. "
"8100510","8102270"," If it's a weekly, it's a different time frame."
"8103450","8107170"," If it's a put up, it's like a zero date on the spy fucking directional."
"8107890","8112610"," You guys have to know that if you're buying zero dates, it's only the move, right?"
"8112870","8114010"," You guys all know that right out there. "
"8114090","8122550"," If you're trading zero dates or one dates on the spy, it's so volatile that they'll reprice these"
"8122550","8122890"," options."
"8125450","8126970"," Especially in this mass down here."
"8127570","8137650"," Two to 88, two to 88, four week high yield, three spots, six,"
"8137830","8139570"," one percent, three spots, six, one percent. "
"8142210","8145430"," U.S. sells $46 billion in four week bills."
"8146330","8149490"," Awards 62 spots, six, five percent of bids at high."
"8150690","8152530"," Give me that put book map back on for you. "
"8152770","8153690"," Wait a minute, what am I doing here?"
"8159020","8161940"," Oh man, this shit sucks."
"8163180","8165940"," I want to see in the one, they're fucking trying to dump this shit."
"8168000","8169540"," I'm going to watch this in a one minute. "
"8172540","8174040"," I'm trying to fucking dump this."
"8178160","8180780"," Gazprom will not sell gas to unfriendly countries."
"8181140","8185740"," If the price exceeds that set by the Russian cabinet, TAS sites, Putin's decree. "
"8186380","8187060"," I don't want to sit here."
"8187100","8190860"," I don't want to fucking sit here until I'll be honest."
"8191000","8192760"," I don't want to sit here until fucking four o'clock. "
"8195320","8198440"," I don't want to sit here all down here until two in the afternoon."
"8202860","8205200"," Should I take a break so that it'll go up?"
"8205780","8206980"," You guys know how this goes, right?"
"8208180","8210400"," If you're just joining us, this is what typically happens."
"8213559","8214620"," We'll do this, right?"
"8214900","8216320"," I'll sit here waiting for the move higher. "
"8218660","8222299"," And I'll be like, fuck this, we'll be like three in the afternoon, and then we'll actually break"
"8222299","8223360"," down or we'll break higher."
"8224340","8228059"," And I'll miss the entire move and come back from my break, and we'll be up here down here."
"8233080","8235180"," Because I'll sit here for like three hours. "
"8245360","8247459"," Hey, Big Spark, does this your first time here, man?"
"8249740","8251219"," Thanks for stopping in, Big Spark."
"8251639","8252400"," Come back again, man."
"8258540","8259660"," Appreciate you stopping by today. "
"8266280","8267740"," It'd be a long tech short though."
"8268500","8269540"," It's a weird place."
"8270040","8271200"," I'll check it out, Chase. "
"8272480","8273559"," I want to be short though."
"8274360","8276280"," Long TLT, long gold."
"8277780","8279200"," There's some parts of tech. "
"8279900","8281680"," Larry Williams was saying to be long on."
"8282139","8286299"," Larry Williams was saying to be long on Microsoft, they think, and Amazon."
"8287820","8289559"," He said not to long test. "
"8292559","8298860"," I think I think other people have called for like, like quality tech companies to long."
"8306020","8307520"," Hey, fish with Panfish Dan, Bernie."
"8307799","8308180"," How you doing, Dan?"
"8310080","8312459"," Yeah, I think he said the low should come in and march. "
"8314320","8314719"," And then."
"8318139","8319080"," Happy holidays, Dan."
"8319360","8320059"," Happy holidays, Dan. "
"8325639","8330780"," Yeah, so the so I agree with that statement that they may or that video that they made."
"8330940","8334480"," The one thing they should have added, if they could have, if Spark Emma could have added to that"
"8334480","8337100"," video, oftentimes price doesn't matter."
"8337900","8342900"," So if you like, we didn't focus on so some of the Tesla bulls were like, some of the Tesla"
"8342900","8347700"," bulls were like, yeah, but it all comes down to this news that's coming out on January 3rd or 5th"
"8347700","8348100"," or something. "
"8348799","8349600"," And I was like, you know what?"
"8349799","8351580"," It doesn't really matter at all."
"8351959","8354440"," And price of Tesla really doesn't matter."
"8355379","8359760"," And if you can get that out of your, if you can get like price out of your brain on"
"8359760","8360219"," that trade. "
"8361620","8363820"," It's more of where are we?"
"8364840","8368420"," Where's Tesla price and we don't care where Tesla price is on January."
"8369120","8375299"," All we know is that when the fucking January comes, they're going to fucking rip Tesla."
"8376000","8377320"," It doesn't matter what the price is. "
"8378080","8379340"," They're going to, well, yes, it does matter."
"8379459","8381139"," If Tesla's already ripped, it would matter."
"8381600","8383820"," They would probably bring it back down to print those puts. "
"8385000","8387680"," But I don't care if Tesla bleeds off into January."
"8388600","8394560"," If Tesla bleeds are trade sideways in January, it doesn't matter."
"8394740","8400120"," It just matters that if it's low, but they're going to fucking rip it like a, like the biggest"
"8400120","8401420"," rocket you've ever seen. "
"8403820","8405200"," Like nasty up."
"8407060","8407460"," Nasty."
"8407700","8408320"," I think that was it. "
"8408480","8410580"," It'll be like a 20% move, maybe."
"8410780","8412900"," Like that big, that big of a move."
"8430800","8433100"," I mean, this is all constructive here. "
"8433240","8434720"," This consolidation is all constructive."
"8435760","8436280"," We hit S3."
"8436400","8437940"," We're pretty stretched on the day so far. "
"8439040","8443880"," You could get another move down lower here down to, So if you're just joining us, we've got some"
"8443880","8449860"," previous, this yellow line right here is still showing up on book map."
"8450120","8451680"," This is a previous low down below."
"8452500","8457760"," We hit a previous low above here, just above from two days ago, I believe. "
"8458520","8465200"," And I've got another low from that same two days ago down here at 377.83. Then we're still kind"
"8465200","8471400"," of in this expanding megaphone bullshit down here, 376 ish down here."
"8472220","8475440"," So we're either going to break higher, break lower, we'll consolidate in here."
"8475520","8477220"," This could take all day long, believe it or not. "
"8478020","8480520"," You could probably straddle this at some point if you wanted to."
"8481500","8487900"," You could straddle this or strangle it, get some OTM puts and some OTM call or OTM puts and OTM"
"8487900","8490500"," calls above here that expire today."
"8490660","8493020"," The one problem is that they're grinding options right now. "
"8493120","8493760"," They're just killing options."
"8495740","8505480"," So regardless of what you're, you could probably buy some 3.80s and some 376s that cost $0.20. And"
"8505480","8507160"," not really care which way it goes."
"8509000","8510780"," So if we trade down here, you'll get paid. "
"8511660","8512560"," Set the diamond hand and manage."
"8513180","8514160"," Same thing over here."
"8514620","8516320"," This is the kind of no man zone in here. "
"8516460","8517680"," This is the grind in here."
"8525860","8530500"," I'll be honest with you, if we go down or up here, I'm probably going to cut out for the"
"8530500","8530680"," day."

"12931650","12940550"," actually that's what we just gapped down right there and then we'll look at a we'll look at a daily"
"12940550","12950440"," chart you have you're"
"12950440","12956700"," looking for that monster move down so if you're looking for that monster move down you can see"
"12956700","12964220"," where uh this got real violence and nasty down here and you see that roll over right there you'd"
"12964220","12970060"," want to see the extension of this down here last time we did that we hit that weekly moving out"
"12970060","12974440"," well this is the weekly now this weekly moving average right here and this will be the weekly"
"12974440","12979220"," moving average right here if we start trading down here you're talking about um what kind of uh"
"12979220","12988300"," talking about let me see if i can tell you what to expect down the road okay that keeps moving"
"12988300","12998100"," down uh you'd be right here right no you say you could come back down pull back up and"
"12998100","13006420"," then another another 13 percent I mean that would be uh if you had if you had a if you"
"13006420","13012880"," had a retrace and then 13 percent I think we said that puts us below uh weekly moving average which"
"13012880","13019040"," is pretty fucking wild and that was done in a very small time frame you see how like rolls back"
"13019040","13025000"," up with a little bit of relief rally here and then woof and this only took uh the 12th of"
"13025000","13032880"," September to the third of September third of uh October so three weeks that took to get us down"
"13032880","13040140"," here that put us into like beginning of January or something down here if if if you get who they"
"13040140","13045260"," guess the implication would be come back up here quick relief rally and then bloodbath it's"
"13045260","13056290"," straight back down into January you pretty fucking wild it's just fast math here so"
"13056290","13061710"," you're going to expect i would say you're going to expect some kind of relief rally here uh the"
"13061710","13065210"," next couple days you might see a relief rally here if you don't you're talking about circuit"
"13065210","13071350"," breakers probably some kind of relief rally for a day or two and if they resume this down if you"

"13109090","13114590"," likely see weekly moving average by beginning of the year there's a fair chance of that weekly"
"13114590","13124290"," moving average come into play uh but before end of the year there'd be something like hold"
"13124290","13134110"," on a second here maybe get you get violent baby trendline"
"13134110","13141030"," something like this and that's that's like December or that's the summer 27th maybe the christmas"
"13141030","13147890"," bloodbath that would be some violence maybe i mean i'm assuming it's going to come out a little bit"

"15445440","15454480"," you're down here on these levels you'll see like 375 370 maybe 50 point drops all the way down they"
"15454480","15461660"," keep this under 350 or 375 right here you'll see 370 will be next so if they can stay if"
"15461660","15469820"," they can stay above this right if they can stay underneath this you'll see 375 you might like this"
"15469820","15485680"," 373 you'll mean nothing either you'll probably go straight down to 370 right here come"
"15485680","15498980"," on now way down there where's"
"15498980","15509480"," the circuit breaker at again way farther down right yeah 360 is circuit breaker 374"
"15509480","15525100"," 77 now just"
"15525100","15554290"," there stepping down next stop 37775 on es so"
"15554290","15565930"," 3789 so yet one four right is"
"15565930","15589590"," 375 yeah it's right down here It"
"15589590","15591190"," shuts down the stock market. "
"15592270","15599090"," So there's levels in the stock market where if we start to crash, sometimes it's computer that does"
"15599090","15607370"," it, sometimes it's panic that does it, and so they'll stop a stock, an individual ticker, or"
"15607370","15615470"," sometimes the entire stock market to give a breather to people to say, hey, do we have to stop the"
"15615470","15617110"," machines right now or not?"
"15617390","15628450"," Usually it's, usually it's, or in the previous decades it was machine selling, or"
"15628450","15631850"," the beginning if you have humans panicking they'll, they'll do the same thing, and then they have"
"15631850","15637610"," to give charters within institutions and say I have to sell at this point, then they have to, we"
"15637610","15641810"," have like waterfall puts come into the market to protect protection, sometimes people say I got"
"15641810","15647110"," margin called, say about puts at the exact wrong time, or is required to buy puts at the exact"
"15647110","15652050"," wrong time, so sugar breakers will just stop the market, give the market a chance to breathe before"
"15652050","15659150"," it continues to sell, and it all stems from what happened, and I believe 1987 was the first time,"
"15659410","15666230"," could've been 89, I can't remember, but I think the argument is that, I've seen a little bit of a"
"15666230","15674030"," squeeze here, not squeeze, but a little bit of a hammer candle here, now low volume though, not big"
"15674030","15681910"," volume, I want to say it was an 87, they just started to switch over to allowing algorithms to"
"15681910","15687750"," trade the market, there's fear of this happening again, because you've got large bank, you see have"
"15687750","15693010"," large institutions that are using artificial, well, it's not real artificial intelligence yet, but"
"15693010","15699970"," there's discussions going on about, if you have two or three major banks, some prime banks, right,"
"15700110","15706410"," and they're all have their AIs working in the background, and there can be a moment where they'll"
"15706410","15712250"," all sell at the same time to try to beat each other down to the bottom, or they trade the"
"15712250","15718030"," same time the same way within milliseconds, and you'd have everybody selling at the same time,"
"15718150","15724390"," everybody buying at the same time kind of stuff, they can lead to disaster, right, so you're going"
"15724390","15731430"," to step in and say, turn off the algorithm, if you ever run an algorithm over a long period of"
"15731430","15736810"," time, it starts, like if you run an algorithm on a short time frame, it'll look up and down and"
"15736810","15742310"," stuff, but if you run an algorithm, oh you guys can't see this, if you run an algorithm over like"
"15742310","15749990"," a year, two years, three years, it just ends up, it gets really messy, it like collapses in and"
"15749990","15754030"," itself, so that's short time frame, you can see that same stuff happen."
"15765030","15774750"," If you posted a chart from Volways, I'll take a look at it, paper clips, oh no, do we had"
"15774750","15781670"," circuit breakers just a couple years ago, we were doing circuit breakers in pre-market, just a"
"15781670","15789850"," couple years ago, we were doing them two, three times a day, on the spy, on cues, on spy, on"
"15789850","15795550"," tickers, I'd go to bed at nighttime, wake up in the morning, we would be hitting the circuit"
"15795550","15801130"," breakers when I woke up, I've seen circuit breaker recoveries, I've seen"
"15801130","15811050"," us go straight, did"
"15811050","15819450"," you guys trade the crash, and then even after the crash, like even after the crash, they were"
"15819450","15829070"," having days where we'd drop, like Trump would come out and say I'm not doing this, and then like at"
"15829070","15835810"," like 4 or 15, you'd come out, you'd like place your bets, and he'd literally come out and be like,"
"15836330","15843150"," fuck your calls, so you'd be panicked all night long, you'd be awake, and you'd see you as like go"
"15843150","15850950"," down 3, 4, 5%, they would come out at like 9, 15, and be like, I just signed it, and"
"15850950","15861030"," we would rip into the open, do any guys remember that shit, it was, it was, it"
"15861030","15870890"," was, you guys don't remember that stuff, weren't you guys trading them, like that shit"
"15870890","15880230"," was fucking wild, it"
"15880230","15890210"," was pure insanity, do you guys remember that stuff,"
"15890450","15899390"," that shit was brutal, it was like, it would just tear through the stock market, that was the"

"15906930","15912170"," probably have to pay for that data, the detail on that data going back, you'd probably have to pay"
"15912170","15917530"," money for that, a lot of that stuff gets erased, like on the minutes, like if you're looking back"
"15917530","15925090"," on the minutes when he was, when he was president during COVID, he was pure insanity, like early"
"15925090","15935090"," COVID, it was pure insanity, we were hitting circuit breakers, we were hitting circuit"
"15935090","15939830"," breakers all over the market, we were hitting circuit breakers on individual tickers, you'd see"
"15939830","15946350"," people on like Wall Street bats and Twitter, they'd just be, they'd just be spamming out tickers"
"15946350","15950010"," that were hitting circuit breakers, these are tickers that you'd never expect them on,"
"15950310","15970190"," for"
"15970190","15978690"," any of you guys trading them, then it was pandemonium, I'll look right now,"

"15988910","15998870"," winking or where'd you post it, it was actually crazy, I don't think I've ever seen"

"16006870","16013290"," yes, the winking remembers it,"
"16013530","16025610"," where did you, where did you post the wink, I've"
"16025610","16031770"," got, I've got so winky, I've got multiple computers running here, so I can't like grab it there and"

"16170960","16180820"," yes, this is the real, this is the"
"16180820","16204680"," first bullish moment of the day today, on intraday at least, first"
"16204680","16206860"," bullish bounce of the intraday just happened,"
"16207380","16217360"," January is"
"16217360","16223900"," when the real pop came up, and"
"16223900","16230600"," then they did, I"
"16230600","16240660"," remember they did them a couple times, they changed the rules of bounce, hello"
"16240660","16241140"," one second here."
"16283980","16295660"," Okay, thank you, thank"

"16379820","16386279"," thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, and I went back on it to use"
"16386279","16390660"," Marketrace, and now it's all in my ass. "
"16408300","16416380"," Oh come on man, you know like Facebook's like a scam site, it's like a straight scam site."
"16429500","16439500"," I just want I just want to turn off all notifications and I can't I'm"
"16439500","16441580"," gonna turn this I'm gonna turn it off."
"16451480","16455800"," Met is like a creepy Facebook's creepy place. "
"16457640","16463919"," It's like it's like it's like when you have those companies that don't save the companies they're"
"16463919","16465599"," like zombie zombie companies."
"16465779","16466880"," That's what Facebook is."
"16476300","16478220"," Yeah, I got on there to do. "
"16479380","16487360"," I got on there to I was looking for, um, a thousand feet of wire and I"
"16487360","16497240"," was looking for a bunch of material that I could find"
"16497240","16499000"," some material on on Facebook."
"16500480","16502840"," Before I go drop fucking a couple thousand dollars."
"16502840","16504939"," So I'm like, I will look. "
"16505160","16506099"," So I turned on Facebook."
"16507040","16510340"," Like I turned it off, but not often that completely off."
"16511279","16513820"," And then I turned it back on and asked me and said, do you want to do you want to"
"16513820","16514340"," allow notifications?"
"16514880","16516439"," And I by mistake, I clicked yes. "
"16518180","16521400"," And now I'm just getting like, ping, ping, ping, ping."
"16521800","16523580"," So I just went back in to try to turn it off."
"16524840","16526460"," And them off one by one now. "
"16528720","16530779"," It's gonna take 20 minutes."
"16559720","16560660"," Yeah, it's really bizarre."
"16560860","16561599"," I looked through it. "
"16563099","16566240"," I looked through like all my old friends and family and stuff on it."
"16566619","16568380"," My wife still keeps it for her family."
"16569939","16574939"," We still talk on it here and there, but I don't talk to any of my family out anymore. "
"16577240","16583119"," Just like column email them and text my family stuff like that."
"16583939","16589419"," So I went looking through like the timeline or feed or something."
"16590939","16593700"," And I got an I am from an uncle. "
"16595680","16596939"," I was like, this is really bizarre."
"16597220","16599320"," So I called him up and he was like, that's not me."
"16601779","16606380"," It was like a fake uncle account or something, trying to get me to click on a link. "
"16607300","16608919"," That's all in like a matter of a week a week."
"16630660","16636700"," Every time I every time I leave, man, whenever I take a break, all hell breaks loose."
"16638099","16638900"," Then we trade sideways. "
"16639439","16640000"," And I'm like, you know what?"
"16640119","16640460"," I'm out of here."
"16679800","16680779"," Oh, yeah."
"16681520","16689619"," I've got an uncle who was like super, super racist, super crazy. "
"16690119","16706860"," Was never like that"
"16706860","16713240"," when he was younger."
"16713240","16722540"," I think he went down like the Facebook, the Facebook, like Echo I watched a documentary"
"16722540","16729700"," recently on vice about a retirement community in Florida."
"16731300","16732480"," Let me look it up. "
"16734259","16738080"," And some of it's like some of it's starting to make sense to me."
"16740800","16744340"," Like you've got like there's some of the people we're talking about."
"16746840","16748960"," Some of the people we're talking about how. "
"16752580","16758919"," So when they're in their generation to see from SEC chair Gensler says crypto proof of reserves"
"16758919","16760360"," reports are inadequate."
"16760380","16763860"," So the crypto firms must do more to segregate customer funds."
"16765279","16766380"," They're talking about. "
"16766840","16771140"," So these old people, these are people that are boomers real blue."
"16771259","16773840"," You guys use words for boomers now that aren't real boomers."
"16774220","16779180"," You guys will call somebody that's like 25 years old, a boomer to a CC chair Gensler did also say"
"16779180","16781680"," that the crypto crackdown is just getting started. "
"16782080","16789720"," But a real boomer, they're probably in their 60s and 70s, somewhere in that age bracket."
"16791020","16795200"," And so that generation was the first generation."
"16795820","16799180"," They're actually connected to younger generations more than they think. "
"16800420","16808880"," They're pretty much the first generation that didn't die home alone with their family."
"16810180","16816500"," So prior to, you're talking about the first generation that came out of the Industrial Revolution."
"16818140","16823700"," You had a time of wealth after World War II, we started to have mortgages and homes and stuff like"
"16823700","16823900"," that. "
"16825360","16835560"," Rebecca had our fed that used interest rates to provide people with jobs, not"
"16835560","16836840"," the best jobs, just jobs."
"16837980","16839880"," So they kept the unemployment rate low."
"16840300","16841100"," Everyone was working. "
"16841940","16847280"," You could get a home loan, which they didn't have home loans for most people prior to World War II."
"16847840","16851040"," So these people created communities in suburbs and stuff like that."
"16851180","16854500"," You started to see medical technology become better, right?"
"16855600","16861400"," And so you have this first generation, the boomers, they were born and you started to see women's"
"16861400","16863660"," rights come in, women's lib. "
"16864060","16872060"," You started to see some civil rights come into this country and now this generation here, right, of"
"16872060","16878260"," older people, they weren't, they made enough money and didn't have to die at home with their"
"16878260","16880300"," families, which still happens around the world, right?"
"16880480","16884800"," When you get old in other countries, your kids are expected to take care of you in your old age."
"16886440","16894900"," And so what they did was they're the first generation that lived longer, had money and wanted to do"
"16894900","16903400"," stuff and not just be like a homemaker or work and die, drinking down at a basement bar or"
"16903400","16905320"," something, sitting at a bar somewhere."
"16906640","16913520"," And they grew out of touch with their younger generations, their sons and daughters and now their"
"16913520","16914040"," grandchildren. "
"16915080","16920820"," In this documentary that I'm watching, there's a whole bunch of these people that went down the"
"16920820","16929740"," rabbit hole, like the Fox News rabbit hole and then OAN and then specifically Facebook groups."
"16930760","16935700"," And normally, before this generation, if you were old, you really didn't talk to too many people."
"16935840","16938720"," You talked like your nieces, your nephews, your grandkids. "
"16939420","16942040"," I was like, you'd watch the TV set, I listened to the radio."
"16943280","16949480"," And of course, these people are all connected now more so than a phone call to a brother, a sister"
"16949480","16953320"," in the same age group or a nursing home or whatever."
"16953900","16959720"," So there's this documentary I'm watching, I was talking about this and a lot of these people are"
"16959720","16963180"," disconnected from their kids and grandkids and stuff. "
"16963580","16964880"," There's a whole swath of them."
"16965480","16971460"," So they're turning inwards and have the ability to communicate with each other in these retirement"
"16971460","16973100"," communities across the United States."
"16974840","16982700"," It's fascinating because in the documentary they're talking about how in Europe this same"
"16982700","16988940"," generation is still integrated in first world countries is still integrated with younger"
"16988940","16989640"," generations. "
"16990300","16992920"," They don't have a disconnect in Europe."
"16993720","16998920"," So as times change, there's still connectivity between younger generations, older generations,"
"16999600","17004860"," whereas there's now this disconnect between younger generations and the US specifically versus"
"17004860","17005860"," older generations."
"17006940","17009720"," So you're not having the interplay, right?"
"17009900","17015740"," The sociological interplay between generations and the US right now. "
"17016920","17022400"," And so you're seeing like paired or stark differences in thinking."
"17025560","17027540"," I'll find out what it's called right now."
"17028920","17035160"," And now of course, because let's say I'm older, I can live longer and I made some money and my"
"17035160","17036880"," children don't want anything to do with me. "
"17036940","17039600"," I've pissed them off, I guess, and then the grandkids aren't seeing them."
"17040760","17045200"," So what they're doing is they're building communities that they're moving to, the building houses"
"17045200","17046380"," in these closed off communities."
"17050240","17052440"," And it's just like me being with you. "
"17052440","17053260"," We know each other."
"17053580","17055520"," We all have similar values."
"17056180","17058340"," And we're in this another echo chamber, right?"
"17058600","17060960"," Echo Chamber in the community, Echo Chamber on the internet. "
"17062600","17069400"," It was crazy because there's even like people selling an image to these people, right?"
"17070500","17075900"," And I'll look at that right now."
"17091920","17098340"," And there's some argument that they're trying to posit in this documentary that part of the issues"
"17099080","17106120"," is that older people are not being integrated into younger generations or younger generations are"
"17106120","17106680"," saying you're crazy."
"17106700","17107460"," I don't want to deal with you. "
"17110280","17114780"," Now, there's probably more at play than just that, but it's fascinating because you don't read"
"17114780","17117580"," about this on, you know, social media."
"17117700","17118700"," You don't read about this in the news."
"17120080","17122860"," It's called, what's the name of the documentary is called?"
"17129860","17132740"," Even if you disagree with this, the documentary is fascinating. "
"17135100","17136300"," Let's see if I find it here."
"17138940","17148120"," And the director of this documentary, she was from, I think she's from Europe, and she came to the"
"17148120","17149600"," United States with her parents."
"17152080","17157340"," And they had, I think her parents had friends in one of these communities, and so they went to"
"17157340","17160500"," visit, and they were just like, this is wild. "
"17161180","17164600"," Well, just different, just a different experience."
"17168460","17170680"," Let me see if I can find this documentary here."
"17175940","17177280"," I don't see it. "
"17234500","17243800"," It's called Ray, it's called golf booze and guns inside"
"17243800","17245400"," boomer paradise."
"17246640","17250600"," Golf booze, guns, inside boomer paradise."
"17252120","17253100"," It was crazy. "
"17268580","17277060"," I know Larry Williams is saying that that you buy this bottom today, and then Val Wiz is saying"
"17277060","17282220"," that you would buy the Christmas bottom for a huge move higher."
"17284600","17290760"," If you want it to be a bull here, we talk about this every day, right?"
"17290920","17293820"," On a one minute chart, we're above the blue line."
"17296740","17299280"," On the five minute chart, are we bullish yet?"
"17300960","17301040"," No. "
"17310520","17312440"," We're not bullish yet in the five minute chart."
"17312640","17314300"," This is the key one, right?"
"17314500","17315840"," You want to see us get above this."
"17316440","17318920"," So if you like, do I start legging into my calls yet?"
"17319060","17321360"," You want to see this get held here to go higher. "
"17323840","17327180"," So the five minute chart for trend, intraday is the big one, right?"
"17328500","17329660"," We're not quite there yet."
"17330080","17331500"," Basically sold us off it, right?"
"17333480","17334360"," Just a few moments ago."
"17334420","17337880"," So you want to wait until you get above the blue line on the five minute at least. "
"17339360","17341600"," I bought calls down here, but you shouldn't."
"17343620","17345340"," And this is not financial advice."
"17345340","17347520"," I'm not going to tell you what to do and not to do. "
"17348140","17349580"," But I tell you what I do, right?"
"17349860","17359560"," I tell you that when I'm trying to get into a trend if we're below this line, we're selling it,"
"17359560","17359800"," right?"
"17360120","17362060"," If we're above this line, we're buying it, right?"
"17366400","17369560"," If we're on buying it above this line."
"17374160","17377700"," But then the bigger, bigger, bigger thing to be looking at is the one hour chart."
"17378580","17380040"," And this is where things get vicious. "
"17381620","17382920"," And you can see it right here."
"17383060","17386540"," I put this, this tag here just to show you it's screening down right now."
"17388280","17392200"," But let's say I take that five minute trade. "
"17393880","17400000"," I'm going to be looking for, I'm scared of this line right here."
"17401700","17402640"," I really am."
"17402820","17403580"," I'm scared of that line. "
"17404720","17410500"," We've broken through enough supports that that trend is broken."
"17410880","17415380"," So, you know, where is the end of day today?"
"17415720","17423480"," If we get above the five minute for tomorrow, it could be 380, it could be 378 tomorrow."
"17423940","17430060"," If we were to just trade this today, and this blue line starts to do this nonsense, we standard"
"17430060","17432100"," that, we could just roll back over again tomorrow. "
"17433840","17443160"," If you wanted to see a trend change, you need to be above the blue line, right?"
"17443420","17448820"," We need to make all this back up, get over the blue line, and then start trading, probably"
"17448820","17451800"," consolidate, and then get above and over it."
"17453200","17454700"," That would give you a new trend."
"17454700","17461160"," And then you've got the four hour trend, right?"
"17461260","17466180"," People love the four hour trend, and that's looking nasty, right?"
"17466340","17470200"," Right up on S1, it's ready to just smack us back down up here. "
"17472340","17475180"," So, if you're a bull, there's a ton of work that needs to be done."
"17475940","17477540"," A whole bunch of work needs done."
"17480600","17486600"," So, the first thing that I'm looking for is, first thing I'm looking for is, or above the one"
"17486600","17487320"," minute chart, yeah?"
"17487660","17487760"," Okay. "
"17488520","17490500"," So, where are we trading the one minute chart to?"
"17494740","17495100"," Right."
"17495240","17497200"," So, if we're trading this one minute chart up now, right?"
"17497580","17498240"," Where am I trading it to?"
"17499100","17500300"," I'm going to trade to the five minute chart."
"17503220","17505980"," It's coming up right here, 376.23, right?"
"17506220","17507400"," I don't want to see it sold off. "
"17509220","17513920"," 376.23. So, I'll do a little box here."
"17514100","17515680"," I don't want to see this get sold off here."
"17524300","17526340"," I want to see us break above this right here. "
"17534960","17535580"," Two."
"17539600","17541840"," What's seriously going on with this shit?"
"17546220","17549700"," I got to do Facebook is all put my shit now."
"17554640","17556400"," So, this is the blue line right here. "
"17558320","17559200"," And so, yeah."
"17559460","17560620"," So, the one minute chart, right?"
"17560800","17561360"," We're above it."
"17562140","17564520"," Up here, you don't want to see a rejection here, right?"
"17565380","17566920"," Because I just put this back on the five minute. "
"17570000","17571380"," They've been teeing off it, right?"
"17582700","17586680"," So, if you are able to get above the five minute chart, we could change trend for the day."
"17587180","17588560"," Trend for the day, excuse me."
"17591580","17593760"," And then I print and shit and hold the calls right now. "
"17593860","17594760"," There's no print in here."
"17595740","17596820"," I'm like, I'm dead flat."
"17598920","17600380"," They're not paying nothing down here. "
"17611140","17625220"," Okay."
"17637720","17641100"," With the drop above, right here's the yellows, the VWAP line."
"17641960","17643340"," It's a 21 EMA. "
"17647020","17648180"," You want to be seen."
"17652180","17656800"," If you want to trend change in the day, trend change in the day, you want to get above the"
"17656800","17657580"," 21 EMA."
"17660240","17661280"," I'm trying to make it higher. "
"17670180","17671400"," You're along two, James."
"17672020","17672580"," I'm along two."
"17689820","17691240"," I'm not going to sell here. "
"17711340","17720440"," I'm not going to sell here."
"17720880","17722520"," I got stopped over here."
"17723020","17724580"," I wasn't here for any of this. "
"17725500","17726740"," I missed all of this in here."
"17728320","17731920"," Then my phone was just blowing up, so I'm like, what is going on?"
"17733300","17738040"," I came back down to where Bloodbath went down here, and I'm like, oh shoot."
"17779700","17780400"," I'm not going to sell here. "
"17795380","17796760"," I'm making some money right now."
"17807960","17809380"," I'm making some money."
"17817020","17818680"," I'm making some good money right now. "
"17818680","17831000"," I'm"
"17831000","17834760"," making"
"17834760","17848520"," some"
"17848520","17848660"," good money right now."
"17848660","17857540"," There's a ton of calls on 380C, 234,000 on 380C, expiring today."
"17859260","17861600"," That would be a huge move went up there. "
"17873160","17878320"," Someone bought fucking 230,000 contracts on 380C."
"17890660","17891220"," Crazy."
"17891720","17894240"," There's crazy calls coming to the market right now. "
"17904240","17906200"," Massive calls coming in right now."
"17906200","17935560"," I'm"

"17954480","17958000"," There are stupid calls coming in the market right now. "
"17964540","17966260"," What's going on in the one minute chart here?"
"17968260","17969840"," They're going to blast off on this."
"17979120","17980940"," That's a pretty big move right there."
"18002040","18006440"," Take a little head and shoulders here, inverse head and shoulders right here. "
"18013500","18017040"," Someone's got massive 380 calls, 380C is expiring today."
"18018720","18019860"," That's right here."
"18020760","18021540"," We'll see if we can get there. "
"18023440","18025380"," Someone's targeting VWAP above."
"18030160","18032180"," That would be a giant day right there."
"18034740","18035980"," We'll see if they can get there. "
"18054940","18057520"," Sorry to be eating, trying to eat a candy bar here."
"18057520","18063260"," I'm going to Jared Deli caramel bar here."
"18063460","18066540"," I haven't eaten since yesterday, so I'm starving. "
"18078220","18082780"," The U.S. funding bill includes a ban on TikTok from government devices."

"18103520","18105480"," The house just passed the funding bill."
"18105480","18112280"," Anybody see that"
"18112280","18117300"," news?"
"18126000","18128480"," Some news coming out about the spending bill passing. "
"18153190","18156390"," I thought this was news, like new news, but it doesn't look like it."
"18178110","18180570"," What do you guys think the chances are we get up here to VWAP?"
"18180570","18186530"," Do"
"18186530","18210550"," you"
"18210550","18210550"," think we get up here?"
"18218610","18226530"," I like to see us at least get right here if"
"18226530","18240530"," we"
"18240530","18240530"," can."
"18243390","18247270"," You want to see us hold this 5 minute PMA. "
"18247270","18250890"," Okay."
"18250890","18279470"," Yeah,"

"18285710","18288250"," I need to see this EMA hold. "
"18310410","18315550"," Yeah, so an hour ago it said it looks like the Senate was poised to approve the government funding"
"18315550","18319570"," bill, so they're saying that they just approved it just now."
"18321310","18328510"," So U.S. Senate passes a sweeping government funding bill and sends it to the house."
"18329230","18330690"," That was just moments ago. "
"18331670","18335730"," The ban on TikTok from government devices is included in the ban."
"18337490","18338750"," So I'm assuming that."
"18340710","18344530"," So you got a ban on TikTok proceeding to the house. "
"18345450","18348390"," That should help out some of the tech companies that are out there, right?"
"18348670","18352930"," Maybe you want to take a look around the market and see if tech companies are getting a bump from"
"18352930","18353150"," that."
"18365690","18373830"," I'll take a look at Google and if they're getting any kind of a pump from that."

"19067920","19068800"," This move cranked. "
"19070120","19071380"," And then it came back and I didn't sell."
"19071380","19072200"," I just stayed in."
"19072640","19073920"," And then it cranked up here. "

"19132780","19134500"," We got three of these C's out there."
"19135240","19136340"," They're never going to let those print."
"19136560","19140160"," Well, maybe they will, but they probably won't let those print up there. "

"19165380","19166720"," And we'll see what happens here."
"19174340","19175980"," Hit and run by the beers today. "

"19484680","19486100"," That was a monster trade. "
"19496720","19498120"," That was a monster trade."
"19501500","19502680"," Here, plus four to K."

"19538540","19539620"," What are you saying, Chase?"
"19539920","19540800"," You're saying it's going to roll here?"
"19544280","19545840"," I'm on the five minute right now."
"19546300","19548680"," Still just kind of consolidating down here."
"19551320","19552920"," Let me look in the background and see what's up. "
"19554620","19556080"," That was a crazy ass day."
"19556620","19558820"," These days, these trading days have been wild."
"19560120","19560840"," Nothing less than wild. "
"19568420","19570220"," These trading days have been nothing less than wild."
"19571960","19573580"," Don't worry, I'll be here with you guys tomorrow."
"19579000","19580620"," Let me take a look around the market real quick. "
"19580900","19583260"," NDX, down 389 points."
"19583700","19587140"," I'm telling you what, there's now a giant gap on NDX."
"19587140","19589860"," A giant that needs to be filled. "
"19593200","19594600"," NDX, here we go."
"19594740","19594840"," Ready?"
"19597000","19598380"," Let's go around the market together."
"19598680","19599620"," I'm not doing this in a different area. "
"19599700","19600160"," I'm going to do it with you."
"19600880","19605280"," Okay, so on NDX, right, we had known buyers here above."
"19607900","19610780"," Right, smashed right through those buyers today. "
"19611320","19615660"," Came down and tapped, set 10, 74, or O2, right?"
"19618460","19620260"," Now creating all kinds of gaps."
"19620480","19622840"," This is the Wiki story and the Ball Wiz story."
"19623460","19627700"," Basically, what they're saying is you see these giant, these are giant ass gaps above, and they're"
"19627700","19628760"," just being left behind. "
"19629760","19631300"," It's not normal to see that."
"19632960","19638420"," And they're claiming that today or tomorrow, but those are going to get filled."
"19638500","19638920"," Do you see these?"
"19639120","19639880"," No gaps down below. "
"19640920","19644000"," Giant gaps above here to fill."
"19645740","19650120"," And Larry Williams, Winky, there's a bunch of people out there."
"19650640","19653480"," Spot Cam is saying we're going to come into January. "
"19654380","19656280"," We got so many puts down below that expire."
"19656280","19658500"," And we're going to see a face ripper."
"19659640","19662380"," And this looks like, I mean, this is just stacking it up. "
"19662380","19666480"," I'll tell you what, I was really super bearish down here, but I'll tell you what, man, you start"
"19666480","19667580"," doing bullshit like this."
"19668760","19670020"," And we come back for that shit."
"19670140","19671340"," We all like stuff like this. "
"19671760","19672780"," You don't leave this shit behind."
"19674160","19675660"," You come back for that kind of shit."
"19676480","19678480"," There ain't no way the Algos aren't coming for that shit. "
"19679120","19679860"," I don't care."
"19679980","19680720"," We sell down here."
"19682080","19683800"," Algos are coming back to close that shit up. "
"19684020","19684820"," That's way too big."
"19688920","19691860"," We hit the retracement above here."
"19692040","19692820"," I think this was 23%. "
"19694720","19698640"," You know, 38 would be up there, I think, and then 68's way up there."
"19701800","19703640"," Markets still not on the bottom."
"19705160","19707460"," The breadth indicator is not at bottom. "
"19708100","19709420"," You saw it on XLU."
"19710600","19712060"," Portfolio managers still hiding out."
"19712820","19713080"," Scared. "
"19713720","19714660"," They're still hiding out."
"19714660","19717600"," So do we go lower and test it and then come back up?"
"19718080","19718820"," I don't know."
"19722240","19728160"," XLF with a double bottom and a giant gap above. "
"19729120","19730280"," I mean, that means something."
"19730540","19731460"," I got to help you out with you."
"19732200","19733300"," That does mean something. "
"19739300","19740500"," That's not undeniable."
"19744700","19745700"," That's a big ass gap."
"19754040","19757000"," You know, we can see is, we'll look at it. "
"19757180","19758200"," We'll show you one thing."
"19758340","19759240"," You guys want to see something cool?"
"19762620","19768080"," So maybe I'll show it somewhere else for you."
"19770140","19771680"," I might not be able to see in this chart. "
"19771800","19772420"," I'm going to have to bring it up."
"19772420","19774240"," What is this?"
"19775920","19776780"," What is that?"
"19782260","19784160"," I'm going to say, what are we looking for?"
"19786380","19786900"," HYG."
"19788760","19790180"," I got some whack chick going on. "
"19791640","19792560"," Okay, so."
"19795160","19795680"," HYG."
"19798200","19800980"," Train way, way out of its range. "
"19804480","19806660"," This is somewhat telling here."
"19807860","19808180"," Okay."
"19808700","19809700"," See how this broke here?"
"19810960","19812920"," It was trying to regain. "
"19815180","19819640"," It was trying to make this way back up into this trend, right?"
"19820700","19821460"," And it failed."
"19823600","19825260"," This is the bearish case here."
"19825460","19827620"," You don't want to see this divergence here. "
"19828720","19834620"," If this divergent starts to grow, if you start to see HYG not recover and do this kind of stuff,"
"19835100","19839700"," and you see the spy going up, that is big time, skull and crossbones."
"19842620","19844280"," Not good for the market."
"19846600","19851080"," So we'll look at that real quick and see how bad this is right here. "
"19854760","19858860"," You know, I wonder if the market breath indicator hasn't updated yet."
"19864240","19868020"," Here's a, you can see, you guys are talking about TLT, right?"
"19868840","19870160"," It's kind of bearish right here."
"19870900","19873400"," It's good for risk, believe it or not. "
"19875200","19877680"," Still, I got 102.96 right here."
"19877760","19878640"," I still want to see 100."
"19879640","19881240"," I want to see, I want to see this. "
"19885300","19886780"," I'd like to see this bloodbath."
"19893720","19894760"," I'll show you some cool though."

"23183980","23186600"," We bought that low almost to the pin strike."
"23186920","23187460"," Boom, right there. "
"23187580","23188160"," That's where we bought it."
"23189280","23190480"," Bought it again right here."
"23190860","23192060"," Bought it again right here. "
"23192320","23194680"," Some crazy people in the stream are like, I'm buying that again."
"23195380","23197260"," We know the 380C was a high concentration."
"23197340","23198340"," They're not going to let them close. "
"23198340","23199600"," Generally speaking, it's a rule."
"23200240","23201020"," I'm not going to let them close."
"23202200","23205680"," We know that tomorrow is last day in the market, right?"
"23205880","23207520"," We know people are going to wrap it up and go home. "
"23208400","23210540"," We know we got the 30th is another big day, right?"
"23212080","23213980"," And that's why we've got PCE."
"23214260","23215620"," We've got core PCE."
"23215860","23220680"," We've got a real disposable income, real consumer spending, durable goods, core capital equipment"
"23220680","23220920"," hours. "
"23222040","23224860"," You Michigan consumer sentiment index."
"23225300","23226640"," We got new home sales tomorrow."
"23227340","23228940"," We got a big day in the morning. "
"23229420","23235220"," All this economic news breaks between 8.30 in the morning and 10 a.m. So we got some volatility"
"23235220","23237320"," set up for tomorrow."
"23238180","23238940"," We know that, right?"
"23240280","23242320"," We got the omnibus that passed the Senate."
"23243120","23244140"," That's a pump event. "
"23244320","23244980"," We know that, right?"
"23246340","23248520"," We're going to look at a one month here."
"23248800","23250280"," We're going to look at a one hour here."
"23251720","23256260"," The key thing for you to know about tomorrow is, see where my mark is right here. "
"23258640","23262000"," You need, if you're going to go long, if you're going to go long into this close, I got to"
"23262000","23263600"," warn you, just like yesterday, I warned you."
"23264020","23265440"," I warned you yesterday on this trade, right?"
"23266140","23270560"," I said you have to be able to hedge futures if you're going to go long into this close."
"23270940","23272060"," I'm going to warn you one more time. "
"23273340","23273680"," Okay."
"23274240","23275380"," You take a long into this bell."
"23276600","23278480"," My recommendation is you take the long tomorrow. "
"23279820","23281120"," Hopefully you get a double bottom."
"23281800","23285940"," If you're going to take the long end of the bell today, I want to warn you that bears are"
"23285940","23286600"," sitting here waiting."
"23288480","23290480"," On an hourly, we have now turned negative. "
"23291280","23293780"," So they want to, they want to roll this right back down on you tomorrow."
"23293960","23294200"," Okay."
"23294680","23295820"," That's at least the warning unit. "
"23296140","23296960"," You could do this."
"23297160","23298780"," We talked about this yesterday."
"23299100","23299840"," Add nauseam. "
"23299900","23300500"," We talked about this."
"23301140","23305600"," If you want to take this long end of the bell here, you want to buy yourself some calls or"
"23305600","23306080"," call spreads."
"23306640","23310260"," Just like yesterday I said, when we were here, I said to you, if you're going to take early markets"
"23310260","23313920"," on close imbalance, currently sitting at nine million to the sell side. "
"23314080","23315920"," You buy some dirt cheap puts, right?"
"23317240","23320300"," You buy yourself some dirt cheap puts, something outside the money."
"23321080","23322220"," 20 cents, 10 cents."
"23322880","23324820"," Take on like a 50 cent call or something. "
"23324840","23326800"," You call it 70 cents or 80 cents."
"23327480","23331700"," So if it does roll, you'll at least get paid to cover your trade, right?"
"23332380","23332860"," Does that make sense?"
"23334320","23336420"," So you want to have, you want to have two sides to that trade."
"23336660","23337360"," Where are some cheap puts?"
"23337360","23342360"," If your directional bias is up and you're paying for some expensive calls, you should buy some"
"23342360","23344140"," insurance on the other side. "
"23344900","23350180"," Otherwise, if you can't hedge in cash and if you can't hedge in futures, then you're flat until"
"23350180","23350420"," tomorrow."
"23350640","23353280"," You're going to wait for news to come out to buy tomorrow."
"23353840","23358420"," And the reason, especially a bull because we are in a downtrend still. "
"23360630","23361930"," I want to show you the four hour chart."
"23362810","23363790"," Same thing, right?"
"23364890","23369610"," So even if we beat that one hour chart, right up here at S1, they're going to, they have another"
"23369610","23370890"," sell sign up here, right?"
"23371510","23375270"," On the four hour, you've got more negativity sitting up here."
"23375690","23379610"," You can actually move this above and move this down below. "
"23380110","23381090"," Bulls have work to do."
"23383430","23386950"," And this is a huge green bar right here, but I want to warn you, bulls have work to do."
"23388470","23392330"," Don't, don't mistake it for, don't mistake this strength down here for. "
"23392330","23397290"," Don't mistake this strength for anything other than another opportunity to roll this market over."
"23397470","23397610"," Okay."
"23398190","23400570"," They have another opportunity up here to roll this market over. "
"23403990","23406610"," And I bullish here on a longer timeframe."
"23406730","23408070"," I'm not in a longer timeframe."
"23408190","23409450"," We need to trade lower. "
"23410690","23414410"," We need, we need, we, we still haven't hit bottom on the breadth indicator."
"23414850","23416250"," I don't know if we hit it today."
"23416250","23417370"," I don't think that we have. "
"23418310","23420190"," I don't know that we have so."
"23421150","23423770"," As far as I'm concerned, we're still going down a longer timeframe."
"23424110","23426190"," So the smaller timeframe on a one minute. "
"23427090","23431530"," Right on a one minute chart, you probably were below the 20, 20 ma."
"23432170","23435790"," If you want to go long, you're probably looking to take that long into the bell down here."
"23437190","23437630"," Right. "
"23438630","23440330"," See, see, buy yourself some calls."
"23441110","23444890"," Buy yourself some puts down, down below something outside the money in case they roll it over."
"23445650","23447510"," There's a couple of fit where we're in. "
"23447650","23449530"," There's one something working for you right now."
"23449890","23451370"," We're in negative gamma right now."
"23451730","23454030"," So dealers are going to buy futures. "
"23454810","23458370"," But even then what you they buy futures and they sell cash tomorrow."
"23459090","23460290"," That can put a hurting on you."
"23460390","23460830"," Makes sense. "
"23461650","23462990"," So you see something like that."
"23463050","23464650"," You could still see it gets sold down."
"23465010","23466630"," We're still not up here at the pivot. "
"23467730","23469870"," So I agree you're going to get a push up here."
"23470090","23472970"," You can get a leg up here if the numbers are good in the morning."
"23472970","23478390"," So let's say you're saying I'm going to buy some calls above on good news before open. "
"23479070","23482530"," I know that the dealers are going to support me at least heading into the open tomorrow."
"23482870","23486430"," But then I'm going to buy some 10 cent puts down here just in case."
"23487430","23488130"," Makes sense. "
"23492760","23493860"," We are sell the rip."
"23494340","23496260"," We are sell the rip right now."
"23497400","23499720"," No matter how you look at it, we are sell the rip. "
"23499860","23501800"," It's not supportive right now."
"23502140","23503980"," S3 supportive for you, but that's about it."
"23506780","23508440"," So I'm going to be aware of that tomorrow. "
"23508960","23513280"," If we go to H.Y.G. H.Y.G. is weak into the bell, right?"
"23513640","23516080"," I would have preferred to have seen H.Y.G. go up."
"23517120","23520100"," Even though Spy is selling up, I would like to see that right there."
"23522440","23527020"," We're going to look at the one hour in H.Y.G. Same story, right?"
"23527280","23528460"," They could sell this down in a minute. "
"23529220","23532580"," We're not in trend mode on H.Y.G. What's the safe trade?"
"23536790","23538970"," You can see where the safe trade is, right?"
"23539190","23541830"," When we're above, right?"
"23542010","23543230"," When we're above here, right?"
"23544370","23545630"," So just be careful."
"23546650","23551510"," Last three days, we had divergence on H.Y.G. versus Spy."
"23552090","23552850"," That's not good. "
"23552990","23553990"," That's not healthy to see."
"23554530","23562190"," So I want to be conscious of this trade down tomorrow into December 23rd."
"23565640","23566080"," XLU. "
"23566880","23568920"," Still tons of fat to sell in here."
"23569700","23571560"," Still a gap to close down below here."
"23572880","23573320"," Dixie. "
"23574340","23575900"," Take a look at Dixie real quick."
"23580440","23582420"," You know, Dixie's basing here, right?"
"23582580","23583760"," You see Dixie basing here?"
"23583860","23584980"," I see some basing on Dixie."
"23586840","23589580"," Right there, bulls really need to see a breakdown here. "
"23589700","23590500"," We're not seeing that, right?"
"23591300","23593340"," We're seeing, we're seeing seller step in."
"23593340","23596240"," Oh, excuse me, buyer step in."
"23596380","23597300"," Buyer step in. "
"23597480","23598400"," Buyer step in."
"23598920","23600100"," Buyer step in."
"23600960","23604100"," So everything is pointing towards weakness in the market. "
"23605160","23607320"," On our chart, what are we seeing here?"
"23608100","23609240"," Supportive of Dixie, right?"
"23610980","23616660"," So, you know, if this starts climbing up here, you're going to see some blood in the market."
"23616740","23618080"," Well, this would represent the Spy."
"23618840","23621720"," But if you see this be supportive, you're going to see some blood in Spy. "
"23622600","23630740"," I know bulls like to beat themselves up, but so just the warning here, okay, that, you know, kind"
"23630740","23636240"," of looks like, kind of looks like unless you get some really great news, it's easy to sell this"
"23636240","23637240"," right down tomorrow."
"23638740","23647080"," Ball whiz, add volatility whiz on Twitter saying that the buy is on the 23rd, the close, or at the"
"23647080","23653860"," bottom on the 23rd, that the buy for a rip higher into January or in the Santa rally or whatever"
"23653860","23658360"," it's called, Elf Rally, Holiday Rally, that's actually on the 23rd."
"23659880","23662740"," So does that mean you can't buy the close here?"
"23663120","23672120"," No, it just means, it just means that you have to get yourself some protection heading into this"
"23672120","23672380"," close. "
"23673240","23682860"," So if I was going to take a trade in the close, I'm looking at December 23rd now, right?"
"23685500","23694020"," There's 168,000 calls for tomorrow that's in the money for 380C, 168,000."
"23695220","23697240"," They're already in the money for tomorrow."
"23698800","23701020"," Calls are expensive for tomorrow, right?"
"23701320","23702240"," They're not cheap, right?"
"23703160","23709320"," So if we had a good day tomorrow, we know the sellers are here, right?"
"23710220","23715940"," So 383s, those things cost 74 cents for tomorrow. "
"23716980","23721760"," And then if they rolled it tomorrow, where would we expect to go tomorrow, right?"
"23721860","23722860"," Or at least the retest."
"23724140","23729600"," So 370, oh, excuse me, 383 Cs, at least the retest down below."
"23735360","23736820"," 374s are 27 cents. "
"23737180","23738500"," That's a dollar trade right there."
"23739820","23740540"," That's all that is."
"23740820","23746900"," So that would mean that your 74 cent trade has to go up 25% just to break even. "
"23748340","23748920"," Make sense?"
"23749440","23750420"," You guys understand these trades?"
"23762540","23763440"," Eight minutes left."
"23774020","23775240"," All right, let's see what's going on."
"23776660","23777420"," Just a second here. "
"23789260","23790800"," Squeezing higher into the bell right now."
"23797760","23799180"," Gorgeous, gorgeous bell trade."
"23799420","23800060"," Look at that over the bell. "
"23800840","23801860"," Gorgeous trade of the bell."
"23802080","23803260"," Back up to S2 right now."
"23804060","23805320"," Tagging S2 into the bell. "
"23814930","23817410"," If you've got 380 Cs, make sure you close them."
"23826660","23826960"," Yeah."
"23830260","23834180"," All right, so we got seven minutes left. "
"23834340","23835640"," I'm going to start wrapping this up with you."

"23849080","23851120"," We'll have a toast or two together until I get sloppy."
"23852020","23853700"," I don't know if we'll be on the entire day. "
"23854900","23858460"," We might cut it short at some point if it gets kind of crazy or whatever."
"23858760","23861900"," It is Christmas Eve for people that celebrate Christmas Eve."
