"136760","137900"," We had to like fly it. "
"138000","140640"," We had to fly in a Boston and then rent a car and drive."
"140640","143020"," Where we were going was like another seven or eight hours."
"143460","146820"," Because the coastline is so huge in Maine. "

"211340","212020"," Yes, no."
"212520","214640"," West Texas used to be really cheap. "
"215620","218500"," I was looking at some properties in Texas recently."
"219740","223800"," I was talking to Joe yesterday about Tampa, but he used to be cheap and it's not anymore."

"260820","261440"," I see 410."
"263000","264880"," There's a big giant gap down here too. "
"264880","265540"," Do you see this gap?"
"267840","270980"," There's a big giant gap in the bottom of my chart right here."

"827700","829440"," Let's see if you can get down to the 417. "
"830460","833440"," If you are in puts, you want to be closing your puts right now."
"834520","837500"," There is a target lower."
"841540","842180"," What's that?"
"843320","843880"," 41735. "
"845120","848320"," The gap is now closed on spoos."
"852950","854310"," Or on spy at least."
"854430","856170"," Let me check SPX really quick. "
"864890","867370"," Still more gap to go on SPX."
"868750","870390"," Look at SPX right here."
"871350","873530"," There is still more gap down here to be closed. "
"875150","877470"," Likely more downside to come on spy."

"1007320","1009100"," PNX still bloodbath in here."
"1021870","1025630"," See if we can get something like that right there."
"1038369","1074680"," Still bloodbath in"
"1116470","1116470"," here. "
"1116470","1118150"," Still more gap to close on SPX."
"1152850","1158810"," Check Visa and waste management, Texas Instruments."
"1175140","1181140"," Bounce here in spy, but look for a rejection up above here. "
"1181320","1184900"," See if you can come back down below your bottom left-hand side of your screen."
"1184900","1188380"," If you can catch one more rip down here, close this gap up."
"1194370","1196770"," I have to take a call for my daughter. "
"1263300","1263840"," Hello."
"1266520","1267680"," Is this Josie?"
"1270260","1271320"," You're on your way home?"
"1273560","1274120"," Drive safe."
"1277180","1278480"," I love you. "
"1278480","1280500"," Let me know when you're nearby if you have any problems with me."
"1282700","1283500"," Bye-bye."
"1293970","1295410"," I think I had my mic on. "
"1299500","1300280"," Sorry about that."
"1300380","1301480"," I had my mic on."
"1301700","1302560"," I was speaking to my daughter. "
"1323660","1325620"," Keep your eyes on the SPX gap."
"1325900","1327220"," Still not closed down below here."
"1328340","1329460"," Looking for a bounce here. "
"1330560","1334740"," I've got no more put, so I'm looking to buy this bounce if I can catch this right down here."
"1335140","1342480"," I don't like this last little gap fill because if they leave it behind and just start heading"
"1342480","1342760"," higher."
"1343540","1344820"," There's a gap right here too. "
"1347750","1349970"," There's now a gap created right here."
"1412580","1415480"," I'm looking to answer some calls right here, but I'm not quite."
"1415820","1417480"," Let me go over here and show you guys this. "
"1419080","1421140"," This is SPX right here."
"1423960","1426200"," This is the bounce squeeze higher."
"1427800","1432940"," Now I'm thinking about buying calls here, but sometimes I leave this stuff behind, but I'm really"
"1432940","1439900"," looking for just to retest that one minute and then the quick closure and then we're out of here. "
"1440300","1444440"," A little bit more down to go here."
"1444600","1451120"," A little bit more."
"1451120","1459070"," I don't see any gaps lower than that. "
"1462050","1466170"," I don't see nothing down there."
"1466290","1468250"," Just that last little bit down there."
"1499300","1501560"," Damn, I'm looking at Friday calls. "
"1501820","1503360"," They're expensive as fuck."
"1539580","1543060"," There's a gap still on HYG that hasn't been filled as well."
"1544280","1553520"," HYG just trading sideways right now and they got a giant gap on HYG down to 7187. "
"1555740","1557000"," Watch out below here."
"1557060","1559600"," If you're in calls, it's not quite time."
"1559800","1561560"," My view, it's not quite time to buy calls. "
"1561900","1563920"," 7187 gaps still left unfilled."
"1565500","1567040"," NDX has a gap and it's filled."
"1568620","1570300"," 14, 618, 1, 5."
"1599920","1603960"," Just sitting here waiting to read the chat. "
"1608550","1609970"," Yeah, my mic was on."
"1610830","1611250"," I apologize."
"1611530","1612270"," I thought I had the mic off. "
"1612650","1614030"," You heard me talking to my daughter."
"1614950","1616050"," That was my oldest daughter."
"1617730","1621890"," My wife and kids are coming back from vacation today. "
"1622050","1623770"," They spent an extra day or two days."
"1639520","1640620"," Dixie's starting to move higher."
"1640800","1642900"," Yeah, Vix is starting to finally move higher right now. "
"1642920","1646040"," I'm looking to see if HYG will close that fucking lower gap and then pull."
"1648460","1651160"," You get the target on spy up here at 417."
"1652740","1654600"," 417, 36. "
"1657000","1658980"," Right there, leave that up right there."
"1660800","1663800"," Gaps being closed right now on SPX."

"1675820","1677180"," I sold Verizon this morning."
"1678480","1681540"," I'm looking to sell Visa at some point today if possible. "
"1681540","1685280"," I want to see if this hourly trigger holds on Visa or not."
"1696760","1698780"," Let's check SNAP here."
"1699240","1700920"," I'd like to trade SNAP if possible. "
"1701800","1709060"," SNAP coming into its hourly trigger at $9.60. That's it."
"1709280","1709360"," Good."
"1714520","1717200"," Goog testing, it's hourly trigger right now as well. "
"1719280","1721080"," SPX closing the gap right now."
"1742740","1744060"," Where is that?"
"1745580","1749840"," I need the screenshot, not the screenshot, not the..."
"1749840","1753180"," I need the screenshot, not the..."
"1753980","1754740"," Better."

"1786250","1807150"," 153.76. That"
"1807150","1810730"," makes no bids for the two-year note sale coming up at the top of the hour."

"1906210","1907750"," And his dad's divorce."
"1909830","1913950"," He's an only son, and I think he's an only son. "
"1915210","1916450"," Yeah, he's an only son."
"1916970","1921690"," But his dad, his dad and mom are divorced, right?"
"1921790","1926470"," His dad's getting much older, and his dad always spent time with him."
"1926590","1929110"," Seeing that gap get closed right now on SPX. "
"1929950","1939840"," But his dad always stayed relevant to"
"1939840","1945740"," his son's life, and this is kind of a cool thing."
"1945740","1953100"," So his dad came over last night to watch a game with his son."
"1953700","1960820"," Now, a son is a professional, has his own life, his own things that he does. "
"1961120","1966560"," But the dad had spent all these years watching sports with his kid with his son, right?"
"1967260","1970260"," So they had something to share when he was younger."
"1971000","1972860"," The son picked up watching sports."
"1974760","1981000"," And he was watching this game with his son last night, which came with my dad. "
"1981560","1982300"," He actually knows his dad."
"1982520","1983500"," Or he kind of knows his dad."
"1983960","1984880"," He hung out with his dad a few times. "
"1985220","1987260"," He actually went to a hockey game with his dad."
"1988420","1989780"," But it's something that they share."
"1991120","1993140"," And his dad's getting older, and he's kind of sick now. "
"1993240","1994620"," Not sick, but not doing well."
"1996280","1999160"," And having his son still stay in his life."
"1999960","2005060"," This guy's like older, he's divorced, and he still has his son and his life. "
"2005780","2009760"," And they're able to spend time together, quality time, all that kind of stuff."
"2009960","2012180"," So you can't give that stuff, or not give that stuff up."
"2012300","2013320"," But what's the point of having kids?"
"2015160","2019460"," I guess if you don't get that enjoyment out of them, out of them when they're adults, right?"
"2021120","2023040"," And so we were talking about it last night. "
"2023400","2025920"," And I was like, you know what, I'm not going to stop by."
"2026220","2027940"," I was going to stop by last night and see him."
"2028420","2032100"," And I was like, I'm just going to stay home, hang out with your dad. "
"2032300","2034220"," But we talked about dads last night."
"2036360","2038480"," And we're almost there."
"2038580","2039440"," Just a little bit more here. "
"2039740","2041180"," A little bit tiny more."
"2041340","2042740"," I want to see that last little bit here."
"2043220","2045900"," A little bit of reversal candle here, but I want to see that. "
"2046060","2047780"," I want to see how a little tiny bit they're taking out."
"2050449","2053909"," Finally seeing HYG with the roll, trying to close its gap to the downside."
"2053909","2062639"," I think we get that 417-2 on spy. "
"2064699","2067639"," See if we can push it down there and grab that 417."
"2074650","2077810"," And we were talking about his dad last night, hanging out with your dad."
"2078489","2080710"," And they were just having guy night. "
"2081150","2082750"," They ride motorcycles together."
"2083590","2086489"," As a matter of fact, they offer me to go up all the time."
"2087290","2089370"," They always like dad and men shit. "
"2089370","2091510"," Like go to a cab and go hike and go biking."
"2092170","2093370"," All kinds of cool stuff."
"2093989","2096070"," And I don't know, Mike, my own daughters. "
"2096830","2102790"," I hope that, I hope that when they're adults, I can partake in their adult life."
"2103070","2104370"," Where they want me to, of course."
"2104510","2105970"," I don't want to close their adult life. "
"2106250","2106410"," This is unexpected."
"2106670","2108630"," It's cost around 5 trillion yen."
"2109470","2112530"," It does bring us now to 10 minutes away from the top of the hour. "
"2113070","2114050"," The US is a GT."
"2114050","2118870"," So the private cover was 2-2-73."
"2119210","2121930"," We'll decline high yield of 5-4-0-8-5%. "
"2126700","2129520"," Come on, close that fucking gap, dude."
"2129780","2129980"," Seriously."
"2133420","2134940"," It's like watching fucking paint peel. "
"2177350","2178630"," Let me see what you guys are saying."
"2185180","2187200"," First of all, we're going to put some slate on McCall's."
"2187320","2188140"," Daughters are good for men. "
"2188340","2188760"," Good for the soul."
"2189100","2189580"," Sons are good too."
"2189780","2190020"," Just harder. "
"2190020","2192380"," Yeah, I like the daughters."
"2192740","2193040"," I don't know."
"2193440","2195320"," Probably wouldn't be the best dad to a son. "
"2196420","2198780"," My father was really fucking hard on me."
"2199000","2202800"," I'm afraid that I would pass that on to my, I think, I feel, not like, you know, it's not"
"2202800","2204080"," real."
"2204380","2208180"," But I'm like, yeah, I probably wasn't giving sons for that reason. "
"2209180","2210900"," Probably wouldn't have been the best dad to a son."
"2213200","2214860"," I would be really hard on them."
"2215220","2218940"," Although my wife is kind of hard on my daughters, but thankfully it's not me. "
"2220240","2221880"," Having sons that I could be hard on."
"2225040","2229120"," I don't have, I don't have to do much to get a reaction of my disappointment to my daughters."
"2231180","2234660"," Here comes that gap right now. "
"2234740","2235980"," It's getting filled on SPX."
"2238260","2239620"," You can catch a bounce here."
"2242880","2244680"," 4-2-1-8-7-9. "
"2248060","2251360"," You plan on imposing your ass off these little turds and getting rid of me?"
"2254160","2257160"," The passing along wealth."
"2257640","2262920"," I like the idea of passing along wealth, but I think that's like a benefit, but not a feature."
"2264100","2270760"," The one thing my dad was, my dad specifically to me, when I was young, did not want to do"
"2270760","2271380"," that for me. "
"2271420","2273060"," He didn't want to pass along any wealth to me."
"2273620","2275260"," He was like, get out there, do your own thing."
"2276740","2278600"," Pull up your bootstraps, son. "
"2279440","2282960"," Put down that avocado toast and take care of yourself."
"2285000","2286720"," But that was really hard on me."
"2287460","2297320"," Now my daughters, I'm hard on them, but I kind of feel like the young people are fucked today,"
"2297440","2299740"," so they can't really do that. "
"2299740","2305500"," But I think I would do the same for my son today."
"2305680","2306380"," I think I would."
"2306520","2310400"," I don't think I would ever treat my kids like my father treated me. "
"2312680","2314720"," But I get why he did what he did with me."
"2315220","2317160"," A little bit more gap."
"2317340","2318800"," Just a little tiny bit down here. "
"2320620","2321260"," We're close."
"2321520","2322260"," We're almost there."
"2322560","2325780"," Just the teeny teeny teeny tiny bit more over here. "
"2333530","2339970"," My father, man, he was hard ass and I didn't like him for a long time."
"2340630","2345790"," I ended up going back and apologizing to him multiple times into my adulthood."
"2345810","2347990"," I realized what he did for me. "
"2348430","2354830"," I realized what he was doing for me now as I get older."
"2356650","2359330"," I'm going to try to turn me into the demand that I am today."
"2359330","2377570"," But at the time, I did not like 15 fucking"
"2377570","2378350"," delta, dude. "
"2378670","2379530"," Are you shitting me?"
"2387150","2389310"," I'm about to add some 429."
"2389870","2393410"," I was going to do 430 C's for Friday."
"2393590","2397990"," They came down from 50 cents just now to 43 cents, but I'm looking at 429. "
"2397990","2399490"," Those are 58 cents."
"2402320","2404000"," That's for October 27."
"2404320","2408800"," Now at the top of the hour, this is due to $51 billion in a two-year note sale. "
"2409520","2411080"," That private couple is two to 73."
"2411580","2414300"," It would be prior high yield of 5.0 to 85%."
"2415080","2419480"," So this week's auction cycle is starting with today's $51 billion two-year note sale. "
"2420100","2425740"," We'll be followed by auctions of $52 billion in five-year notes on Wednesday and $38 billion in"
"2425740","2426980"," seven-year notes on Thursday."
"2427910","2433120"," So worth noting me $3 billion increase in this two-year sale over the September auction offers"
"2433120","2439420"," potential headwinds, but a flight to quality backdrop remains and a large futures short in the"
"2439420","2444620"," tenor shown by positioning data could support the demand as well."
"2445440","2450540"," So JP Morgan's strategist see the larger auction size requiring an additional concession versus"
"2450540","2453640"," Monday's clothing level in order to be digested smoothly. "
"2454380","2455240"," Almost there."
"2455360","2455760"," Almost there."
"2455840","2457440"," The ability and more rubbish recent. "
"2462690","2468410"," So the aforementioned positioning data from the CFTC shows that speculators were net sure one spot"
"2468410","2470450"," three six million two-year note futures."
"2471130","2474630"," A record amount which may support the auction in terms of short covering flow."
"2477990","2480390"," God, I want that one right fucking there, dude. "
"2503880","2507380"," Added some 430 C's for October 27th."
"2512490","2515430"," I was going to go for 29, but I went with four fucking 30."
"2515650","2516150"," So fuck it. "
"2517330","2519950"," So Friday 430 C's."
"2522210","2528270"," I still think we close this shit out, but we're in case they leave this little fucker behind back"
"2528270","2528610"," here."
"2530430","2536450"," So I'm long right now 430 C for October 27th. "
"2537750","2540450"," They could still reverse this and come back down here."
"2540530","2545950"," You could still see a little sneaky like squeeze up here and then boom deck back down and then off"
"2545950","2546430"," and running."
"2546710","2551330"," We also didn't tag S1 yet either. "
"2552370","2554490"," No, VIX is not showing."
"2555810","2558530"," The VIX is not really showing like doom and gloom."
"2559010","2560770"," Better that stuff and then HYG. "
"2562670","2565650"," That's in relation to that two-year note is just sitting there."
"2568610","2570410"," Just hustle in sideways right now."
"2570590","2572890"," So you could still see a quick reversal here. "
"2574730","2575990"," Bloodbath and then the bounce."
"2580230","2583470"," Sometimes they like to leave that little tiny bit though back here."
"2583470","2586270"," So we'll keep an eye on this and see if it reverses. "
"2587410","2588770"," I'm going to bring that down."
"2592210","2593330"," That's fucking stupid."
"2600700","2603040"," See if they tagged that last little bit down here. "
"2613310","2615010"," But yeah, my kids like I want to be around."
"2615290","2618050"," I don't know why you would have kids if you couldn't enjoy them, right?"
"2618210","2619970"," Or have them in your life as you get older."
"2620630","2625410"," That's one of the things like if you're going to have kids, why did you have your kids?"
"2625990","2628210"," I guess you have some other motivations. "
"2628210","2631730"," But for myself, I had my kids because I like life."
"2633230","2636390"," And I want to share my life with them."
"2637090","2640750"," And then I also want to be there for them as they grow older. "
"2641130","2645370"," And I want to enjoy them as I go grow older and die."
"2645570","2647090"," I guess that can be kind of greedy."
"2652930","2661010"," But just to note here, you had a bounce on waste management on their 153.70 right around there. "
"2661050","2663030"," I think it's trading $1,438 right now."
"2664690","2665330"," Microsoft."
"2668150","2670710"," Oh, that was almost too perfect right there. "
"2672070","2673490"," Check Microsoft really quick."
"2674430","2680060"," This is the one that I'm interested in."
"2681900","2685880"," Microsoft coming back down into not quite where it should be. "
"2686000","2691340"," It didn't catch the 326.82. I really want to see."
"2691940","2701220"," It's trading 328.10, 328.05. Let's see if Microsoft can grab that lower end that 326.82."
"2701220","2705820"," When you shoot 2G yield, 5.055% ahead of the auction."
"2706460","2715200"," So again, pre-sale when you shoot yield at 5.055%. Seeing a reaction now to the upside on HYG. "
"2719560","2721400"," Dixie going higher right now still."
"2722880","2723500"," Bounce on Apple."
"2724140","2725900"," Bounce are big still trading higher now. "
"2727100","2728000"," Bounce on TNX."
"2728520","2729720"," Bounce on NDX."
"2731740","2742760"," NDX in a 5-minute look for a rejection above at 1466.9.52. Maybe"
"2742760","2743160"," 673. "
"2749260","2749920"," Green, baby."
"2751500","2756360"," They make kids like, I guess it's kind of selfish right to say, hey, I want to have kids."
"2756620","2759280"," I want to, I fucking had a great life. "
"2759440","2761380"," I'm like, I want my kids to have a great life."
"2761380","2768640"," And then maybe it's kind of like selfish to be like, yeah, I want to also have kids."
"2768980","2771080"," So they have a great life, but then so they spend time with me. "
"2771540","2775460"," And then, you know, when you grow old, if you don't have kids, you have to create friendships and"
"2775460","2778480"," have family that'll be there with you."
"2779280","2783820"," Unless you're a person, I guess I would understand completely, except some friends that are like,"
"2784380","2785900"," they're single and they like being single."
"2786140","2788680"," They like solitary living and all that kind of stuff. "
"2788680","2791720"," So I guess if I was that kind of person, I probably wouldn't have had kids either."
"2792380","2794800"," So I understand that, that want to need as well."
"2799750","2801490"," What are your thoughts about having kids?"
"2801730","2806910"," Do you guys like kids or don't like kids or can't afford kids or want to be able to afford"
"2806910","2809450"," kids or you have kids or they're grown up?"
"2809770","2810410"," They're not easy. "
"2810610","2810950"," They're expensive."
"2811370","2811790"," They're not easy."
"2812090","2815170"," They take all of your time, or at least all of my time. "
"2815670","2817770"," They like encompass my entire life."
"2824230","2825890"," So you get to cover right here."
"2825990","2826370"," Two to 60. "
"2827270","2828530"," You guys are putting up here."
"2829650","2831330"," I'm not getting YouTube comments again."
"2831650","2833070"," What the fuck is with YouTube, dude?"
"2834490","2835170"," It's a pyramid. "
"2835490","2836310"," Paps, earnings play."
"2836550","2837470"," There's a two-year note option."
"2837770","2839610"," You should put price here in one of a minute or so. "
"2839830","2839890"," Yep."
"2840110","2841730"," It seems like 40 has to get 40 days."
"2842350","2843050"," Old dads and Netflix. "
"2843330","2844370"," You guys watch that one."
"2845170","2847290"," You need a female in most cases."
"2850830","2852350"," They'll leave in this gap down here. "
"2852350","2853270"," I don't like it right now."
"2853370","2854370"," I'm looking at this gap on SPX."
"2855090","2855730"," I'm like this stream. "
"2855730","2856630"," You must boss it by."
"2856830","2857170"," It ticks right."
"2857170","2857450"," Damn it. "
"2857790","2860710"," It ticks right allows you to actually hear water flowing futures."
"2861110","2863430"," It just knocks that fucking gap out."
"2863450","2865290"," That's free trial at ticksright.com."
"2865450","2867350"," It's right in 51 and 430 C right now. "
"2867490","2868490"," It's looking pretty good."
"2868650","2870590"," They're at 44 cents just a little while ago."
"2874210","2877270"," You've got kids of the hardest thing in life, but they're also the best part of life. "
"2878430","2879870"," Nice little bounce down there."
"2879970","2882570"," Let's see if they get this rejection of the downside or not an SPX."
"2882770","2883490"," I don't know if they will. "
"2884390","2885830"," Not out of the woods yet for bulls."
"2894190","2895690"," A little baby girl coming in."
"2895850","2897290"," Day now girls are awesome dude. "
"2897610","2898470"," You're going to love your daughters."
"2899650","2902250"," Like baby girls are like the best."
"2902690","2904970"," Like the balls of joy and wonder. "
"2908670","2909830"," Son is the greatest thing in my life."
"2909930","2911350"," My social life and everything else just enjoyable."
"2911710","2913170"," Life has been dead since he was born. "
"2914130","2917330"," Yeah, there is some better sweetness to it too, right?"
"2917330","2920130"," And there is a lot of adjustments to lifestyle."
"2921150","2925510"," You know, one of the hardest things for my wife and I was one of the hardest things that we"
"2925510","2930350"," went through was all the adjustments as the kids grew up."
"2930490","2933630"," Like of course, when they're babies, you can't do what you used to do. "
"2934030","2938150"," Last up, two spot two basis points around 5.0, 8, 3, 9%."
"2938890","2945090"," Then there's a moment where you can do whatever you like you can cycle back into doing what you"
"2945090","2946950"," were doing before because they're not in school yet."
"2946950","2948210"," You're like, you want to go do this?"
"2948250","2948710"," You want to go do that?"
"2948790","2949350"," Put them on the back. "
"2949510","2949790"," Go here."
"2949890","2950230"," Go there."
"2950510","2951050"," Do all this stuff. "
"2951850","2952510"," But then they go back."
"2952690","2955510"," Then they're like back into child care and school."
"2957290","2965530"," And even right now our life is, I thought our life would get easier as our kids grew older. "
"2966310","2970850"," Keep your eye on this down here where there still could be more like, still could be this more like"
"2970850","2971890"," bam to the downside."
"2972610","2973890"," And then that run higher."
"2975390","2980310"," So if you're still in bot, anything here, you still have a chance down here to possibly see this"
"2980310","2980910"," gap get closed. "
"3017150","3019390"," Mark up or mark down Wednesdays."
"3023090","3025530"," Straight in 53 right now."
"3027990","3029970"," There's another gap up here in SPX. "
"3030130","3031630"," I'm going to switch back to spy."
"3033930","3035150"," Switch back to spy app."
"3035290","3036690"," We start to turn back down to the downside. "
"3036770","3038550"," I'll switch back to SPX."
"3038950","3040910"," Looks like they're leaving the door open down below."
"3041250","3045090"," The algorithms are like, yeah, we'll leave that down there just in case you need to come back and"
"3045090","3045670"," revisit it. "
"3047230","3049690"," So you get the spy gap filled up here."
"3049690","3050370"," That was filled."
"3050650","3055110"," And then you had a little bit of a sneaky Pete on SPX down below. "
"3055230","3056230"," So this gap is done."
"3058730","3063010"," Now for the bulls, what they don't want to see happen is they don't want to see a rejection above,"
"3063290","3063370"," right?"
"3063510","3064290"," They don't want to see us."
"3064830","3070030"," We don't want to see like the the the the scream higher up here to the hour and half hour"
"3070030","3074730"," in the rejection to the downside to trade out that that S one down below. "
"3076490","3078310"," So that's our weight non right here."
"3078390","3079710"," That's that S one down here."
"3079750","3080950"," Don't want to see this, right?"
"3083730","3090570"," You should be positioned at this point for earnings should have no reason not to be positioned"
"3090570","3090990"," here. "
"3091910","3095890"," The one thing that we're not we don't want to see is that kind of bullshit down there, right?"
"3096090","3100350"," Then you get into earnings and you get told yes or no end of day."
"3103540","3105620"," So we'll keep this one open down here."
"3114300","3115440"," There are better. "
"3115860","3117240"," There are triple leveraged."
"3118320","3119720"," Well, let's look at the."
"3120180","3121420"," Yeah, so it is down there. "
"3121580","3123180"," It actually isn't my target right now."
"3124840","3125780"," Hold on here."
"3127280","3129920"," I got a target of it of 8028. "
"3131920","3132960"," And 6981."
"3135140","3141020"," So my target on T L T was 80.28 and we're we're fucking right there, dude."
"3142740","3144540"," Still no reversal, though. "
"3146740","3148400"," What I would say is this."
"3149640","3151460"," If you're looking for."
"3152180","3153260"," It's a T L T."
"3154780","3156560"," Fuck, it looks like a T L T right now. "
"3157380","3160620"," Okay, so we're going to switch over to trigger full screen."
"3161700","3162960"," We're going to go to T L T."
"3166160","3169320"," We're going to look at one day."
"3170720","3177340"," I don't know if you can see these yellow lines that I have here. "
"3179800","3181480"," Why are these important to me?"
"3181920","3183520"," There's a couple things I want to show you here in T L T."
"3184240","3185040"," So number one."
"3187860","3189500"," Why do I like T L T here?"
"3192280","3193980"," I measured this out."
"3195340","3197400"," But you've known demand down here. "
"3198980","3200220"," 8028, right?"
"3201180","3204640"," So known demand down here is all known."
"3205260","3211240"," I think I measured out that move down 6981 down there."
"3213120","3219060"," What I buy T L T here. "
"3219060","3222300"," And that is that if you look back on this, even here."
"3223760","3228520"," If you look back on this in the future, like a year, two years, three years, I don't think it's"
"3228520","3228960"," going to matter."
"3229100","3229740"," It's going to be up. "
"3230460","3234460"," You look back like when we're when we're microscopic T L T."
"3235400","3236460"," It's not going to matter."
"3236600","3237840"," You're going to look back in like two, three years."
"3237960","3239440"," I'm like, I should have fucking bought, right?"
"3240920","3244120"," Now on what you want to be looking for in T L T here. "
"3245220","3248700"," Is for this right here, at least on velocity."
"3250320","3252800"," You see all this velocity coming down in the daily."
"3253120","3255560"," This is the weekly velocity and this is the monthly velocity. "
"3256480","3259360"," Even this bottoming down here, this is a higher low right here."
"3260940","3263760"," My thought process here would be, yeah."
"3264900","3268620"," If you set your sights on much farther down the road. "
"3270640","3273160"," Six months, year two, three years down the road."
"3273940","3277080"," You're going to look back on this and be like, I should have bought that fucking dip, right?"
"3278220","3280040"," Can it go down to that 68 bucks?"
"3280360","3280660"," Absolutely."
"3287020","3292980"," If you're looking for more short term, there are better ways to express T L T."
"3293480","3294400"," There are double triple. "
"3294640","3298000"," You just got to bounce off that hourly trigger to see it on spoos."
"3299560","3301020"," Now T L T, right?"
"3301320","3302860"," Let's do the 30 minute here."
"3303600","3305060"," So in the daily trigger, it looks great. "
"3305700","3307020"," The daily time frame, excuse me."
"3308160","3311260"," In the 30 minutes, that looks great as well."
"3311680","3318610"," Now saying that T L T is above its hourly trigger. "
"3319470","3320810"," That's a nice bounce right there."
"3321430","3323870"," Your target is 87, 85."
"3325550","3332490"," So your target right now for T L T, if you wanted something more short, short term, I would say"
"3332490","3339930"," get a triple leveraged way to express that trade to the upside to trade that 87, 55 price target. "
"3340330","3346030"," Your target above that, you're likely going to get some kind of sell to the downside from there."
"3346830","3347830"," You'll see it right there."
"3348010","3351050"," You'll try to sell it back down to you or you break above it. "
"3351650","3352470"," Start to consolidate."
"3352770","3355470"," The hourly comes up and starts to bring it up to your second target."
"3356350","3362690"," So like a triple leveraged option, I would say take the money and run up here and then wait for"
"3362690","3364110"," it to get above the 87, 55. "
"3364650","3366170"," And then you can trade the 95, 80."
"3366970","3370510"," Now it would be your range right there somewhere down in here."
"3371330","3375010"," And then consolidation, then that daily comes up and lifts you above here. "
"3376030","3378250"," And you can rocket ship this to the upside."
"3379050","3380090"," Yeah, I like T L T here."
"3380330","3380550"," I do. "
"3380670","3380950"," I like it."
"3381070","3382270"," You're above the hourly trigger right now."
"3382270","3388870"," I love it on the intraday, I guess, right now. "
"3389230","3391930"," You don't want to be below 84, 16 on T L T."
"3393570","3399990"," And what you need to know here is, you know, let's say you come up in here, right?"
"3400210","3404050"," You don't want to be long here because you can get the rejection, the continuation of the downside."
"3404210","3404610"," Okay."
"3405730","3407510"," Now you can take that long there. "
"3408130","3411430"," You don't want to, if you start to see this happen, you're going to get short, right?"
"3413330","3421130"," But if price breaks up into here, whoop, and holds, you're then stuck with trading this zone."
"3421470","3422030"," Does that make sense?"
"3423490","3424450"," Until a decision is made."
"3425750","3428110"," So you can only like trade this inside this box. "
"3428470","3434550"," Now you can't get like max, you can't like take a short here and just hold it expecting that to"
"3434550","3434930"," happen."
"3434930","3437610"," It could reverse back up on you, right?"
"3437770","3438030"," Make sense?"
"3438750","3442510"," You can trade inside here, but you can't get like conviction trading in here."
"3443650","3449650"," Now, if price does come up in here, we bounce up and down and it resolves to the downside. "
"3450790","3452330"," Yeah, you can do a conviction trade there."
"3453350","3458850"," If it resolves to the upside and breaks above and you get the daily trigger helping you out and the"
"3458850","3459970"," hourly trigger helping you out."
"3459970","3467250"," And it resolves to the upside, you can then take that conviction trade above to the upside to clear"
"3467250","3470230"," all this crap out back here and try to get some new highs. "
"3471150","3475030"," So this box right here that I'm showing is the simplification of this, right?"
"3477290","3479710"," Is the like the zone for you."
"3479910","3481430"," It's very important for you to understand this zone."
"3481630","3483070"," Now I will say something to you. "
"3483250","3485810"," On a 30 minute time frame, this looks gorgeous."
"3486230","3487450"," This looks kind of okay."
"3487450","3490770"," Okay, okay, okay, but that one right there looks gorgeous. "
"3491630","3493170"," So maybe we come up here, right?"
"3493450","3495830"," Trade $226.85, bounce back down."
"3496750","3499710"," You get the hourly trigger to help you get inside the box."
"3500030","3502350"," Once you're inside the box, you're trading this. "
"3503030","3506070"," Meanwhile, as the days pass, these come down here, right?"
"3506770","3512770"," And they pick you up to grab you to go up here and trade that $247.50. Maybe you get"
"3512770","3515830"," another rejection, the hourly comes back up and the daily comes back up."
"3515830","3517710"," And that's the power move right there."
"3518090","3522570"," That $235 or so right in there is the power move for you if you're a bull to the upside. "
"3522990","3524870"," But this whole zone in here, be careful."
"3525070","3529590"," This is like very, this is all day, territory in here."
"3529810","3532350"," Like this is the, this is the finger trap for bulls right here. "
"3533670","3534930"," That's Tesla for you."
"3539030","3542090"," Okay, Tesla did that, did that one."
"3548340","3550540"," No S1 yet for the bears. "
"3552440","3554420"," Bears thinking that we were heading lower."
"3554680","3558780"," Bears thinking that they were going to rain on the bull parade this morning."
"3560380","3562680"," Just, just trying to grab some liquidity. "
"3563080","3564040"," Just trying to get some stops."
"3564460","3567420"," Just trying to get everybody all beared up."
"3569360","3570480"," Manipulation Tuesdays. "
"3575700","3578340"," Have a bull cross coming up right here."
"3579720","3582120"," Bears with no will to go down right here."
"3583320","3586160"," Gonna expect this trade right here to happen. "
"3586540","3589580"," Get above this, come back down and then wham to the upside."
"3596120","3600260"," I thought it, so the market up scenario started yesterday."
"3602380","3603280"," Not today. "
"3605140","3606340"," That's it began yesterday."
"3606340","3607380"," It began on Monday."
"3608840","3615260"," What happened was last week career low is they had a stop hunt that began on Wednesday. "
"3615680","3617140"," I believe Tuesday or Wednesday to the downside."
"3618920","3620920"," And they got that big fat print."
"3621180","3622460"," They got the big fat French and bonds. "
"3622740","3624560"," They picked that print the downside in a Friday."
"3627900","3631420"," And then the real trade was on Monday to the upside."
"3631420","3635460"," So Monday was the day he should have been long, found a low. "
"3638040","3640320"," And I don't know how long."
"3640500","3646500"," The only thing that I would not, I would be tacit about on that opinion that you read."
"3647980","3653440"," The only caveat I would say here is, or the only caveat. "
"3653760","3654920"," Well, just okay."
"3655220","3655680"," So I said this."
"3656420","3658420"," Some people know this and some people don't. "
"3658420","3662160"," Some of the shit I don't say publicly to anyone, even in the discord to anybody."
"3662320","3665080"," Because I don't want to, I don't want people trading this stuff."
"3665520","3668000"," And being like, Hey, cap, fuck you. "
"3668860","3671640"," So if it doesn't go that way now."
"3673580","3676020"," This is the time for you to place your Christmas trade."
"3676660","3676780"," Okay. "
"3679200","3679860"," You should."
"3680440","3682760"," This is the time, not financial advice."
"3683020","3684600"," Do not follow my advice. "
"3687570","3688450"," My facts."
"3688650","3688870"," Fuck it."
"3688930","3689250"," I said it. "
"3689350","3689470"," So."
"3691990","3693230"," I'll say, I'll say it publicly."
"3693490","3706940"," I would set"
"3706940","3707440"," it everywhere. "
"3725900","3726820"," There said it."
"3738310","3738750"," Okay."
"3738950","3739450"," So I made it public. "
"3741730","3743090"," There's some caveats to that."
"3745390","3747090"," It's like the holiday trade started yesterday."
"3747670","3749770"," People are going to get pissed even saying that. "
"3751010","3753070"," Lasted into December 31st."
"3757350","3762790"," Saying that though, there are material risks to the downside to the market and that holiday trade"
"3762790","3763930"," not playing itself out."
"3764410","3769910"," They can definitely go against the crash trade that you guys are all talking about the past five"
"3769910","3770190"," days. "
"3770190","3773110"," I was longer now, right past seven or eight sessions."
"3773750","3776090"," The black market holiday massacre."
"3776630","3776930"," I don't know. "
"3777010","3778390"," That's the black Friday."
"3778790","3781390"," Black Monday in 1987."
"3781670","3782090"," All that stuff. "
"3782710","3783250"," Yeah."
"3783490","3785130"," Like, is there more downside possibilities?"
"3785570","3785610"," Yes."
"3786590","3792330"," But in and around, in and around even last week, the trade was viable, even with the move down last"
"3792330","3792630"," week. "
"3793290","3797970"," For like a December 31st, or if you want to find out how you structure the construction for January"
"3797970","3800430"," and closing in December, but."
"3802590","3803410"," That's all valid."
"3803730","3807510"," The only my personal or my two issues that I have with the trade. "
"3808630","3810290"," There's always risk with that trade, right?"
"3810450","3815010"," But the two, the concerns that I have is the first one would be."
"3816590","3818470"," My first concern is."
"3823190","3824370"," How do I word these two?"
"3824550","3829730"," I just press these two concerns that I have the legality of Israeli occupation of Gaza. "
"3832990","3834450"," The first one that I want"
"3834450","3844990"," to"
"3844990","3844990"," say is."
"3844990","3846210"," Like, there's absolutely."
"3849930","3855170"," There's an inherent risk to the market from banks and. "
"3856230","3858290"," As we said, this whole year, right?"
"3858830","3860790"," Let's go back to October to today."
"3861070","3861290"," Okay."
"3862290","3862910"," It's whole year. "
"3863070","3865150"," We've talked about October of last year."
"3865150","3866510"," It's about over last year."
"3868930","3871950"," We knew and know that. "
"3873750","3877310"," Or at least I know that we, I guess I've always said."
"3878190","3881550"," That I expect at some point into spring."
"3882090","3884050"," Of 2024, maybe summer. "
"3885230","3891010"," To go back down and recheck that October low of 2022."
"3893650","3898910"," That and that that's all a function of the end of rate increases."
"3899730","3901330"," The rise in unemployment. "
"3902450","3906010"," A bottoming of inflation true or not."
"3907690","3911070"," So inflation trade rate GDP sliding off."
"3913930","3918810"," We've talked that if you've been the stream for with for me for years now, you know this trade. "
"3918810","3921750"," And we almost always do it."
"3921890","3923450"," So you go back and you check, right?"
"3923810","3925530"," Now there's a mechanic in here where."
"3926090","3930650"," There's a mechanic in here where the for where Jerome said this last. "
"3932330","3934630"," Showed and said in this last rate increase."
"3935210","3936030"," There's a disagreement."
"3936530","3938410"," There's even analysts out there. "
"3938470","3939850"," I read you some analyst comments yesterday."
"3940570","3941290"," This isn't me."
"3941450","3942350"," This is like professionals. "
"3943990","3946370"," And even their professional opinion is."
"3946370","3949750"," They're calling out the Fed and saying, fuck you, you're not."
"3949990","3954290"," There's no way you're going to have higher rates for longer into December of 2024. "
"3955130","3956390"," That all ain't happening."
"3956910","3959850"," So there's likely like a positioning from banks here."
"3960590","3964930"," To say, fuck you, we're going to, we're going to front run this shit on you into spring and summer"
"3964930","3966070"," of 2024. "
"3966850","3969430"," And we'll see if you're fucking still raising rates then."
"3970130","3970850"," You know what I'm saying?"
"3971930","3975630"," The mechanics of this is where unemployment is rising to five, six percent."
"3976310","3979650"," Into the summer, fall and winter of 2024. "
"3980770","3984070"," And he's hammer away raising rates or threatening you."
"3984850","3989270"," The reality is they're going to be chasing as price goes down."
"3990070","3993170"," And trying to cut rates as that destruction happens. "
"3994310","4000130"," Now the banks also tend to front run these things and try to guess second or not second guess it,"
"4000130","4004530"," but they try to start it before it's going to happen, right?"
"4004690","4009390"," So you've got analysts out there that are like, hey, where are we at right now?"
"4009430","4010910"," It's October 24th, right?"
"4011270","4015890"," So the clock is ticking for a bull for that to happen in 2024."
"4016810","4019010"," And so that's likely to happen."
"4019230","4027330"," So that caveat would be does it happen sooner than later or later than sooner, right?"
"4027330","4030690"," It's not something that's predefined like, oh, it's going to happen on February. "
"4030930","4034510"," It's going to happen in April or where that those targets are."
"4035690","4039210"," So can we have like a Christmas rally from here in 10 of a year?"
"4039390","4039530"," Sure."
"4041250","4042330"," Tempe your expectations. "
"4042750","4045350"," And then do I expect some kind of a roll down and next year I still do."
"4045770","4049570"," I don't expect them to be raising rates into December of 2024."
"4049570","4054790"," No matter what the fuck it tells you, I don't because I see unemployment raising or rising into"
"4054790","4055710"," December of 2024. "
"4055710","4058170"," I see a bottom to inflation."
"4058690","4065330"," I see those GDP sliding off slightly and analysts are telling you that same thing."
"4065490","4070650"," Regardless if it's a mild, no recession or not, we're going to go back and check those that fucking"
"4070650","4071510"," low in October. "
"4071850","4077750"," It's not guaranteed, but it's I mean, if we break above the previous high from December of 2022,"
"4077750","4079030"," right?"
"4079430","4083310"," We're still going to go back and check it once more more time, even if it's just a touch and"
"4083310","4084130"," go into the upside."
"4084570","4086110"," We didn't get it this year, right?"
"4086270","4087790"," We didn't break a new high right now."
"4088410","4093270"," We didn't get the new high to even come back and check the previous high of right now in December"
"4093270","4093850"," of 2022. "
"4095350","4096990"," Just touch and go and move forward."
"4097210","4100649"," We're being rejected right now in the previous high of December of 2022."
"4101649","4107270"," So likely, likely one way or another, we're going to do that some kind of a function of that in"
"4107270","4107770"," 2024. "
"4108710","4113689"," Some kind of a function of that, whether it's whether it's a new all-time high from 2020 to"
"4113689","4114569"," December of 2022."
"4115529","4116930"," Let me explain this better to you."
"4117029","4119029"," Let me show it to you in a better way. "
"4119490","4120010"," Hold on here."
"4124149","4125029"," A new layout."
"4127609","4129109"," Let me express this in a better way. "
"4129189","4133490"," If any guys understand about accumulation and distribution, I'm going to simplify this for you,"
"4133590","4133689"," okay?"
"4137649","4139450"," This is with nothing on it."
"4139649","4140470"," Just an SPX chart."
"4141229","4142490"," Real simple here. "
"4143050","4144930"," Gather around young traders."
"4145270","4147370"," Old traders can follow me in all this stuff."
"4148550","4149729"," You're a young trader. "
"4150810","4152029"," You probably don't know this."
"4155220","4157840"," So previous high back here in SPX, right?"
"4159819","4161800"," There's a couple likelihood scenarios."
"4162640","4165140"," We trade up, you get the new high, right?"
"4165140","4166340"," Whoop, right there. "
"4168779","4174060"," And you recheck it and continue higher, okay?"
"4175279","4179750"," Or, hold on here."
"4188910","4191130"," Rather than talking about it, we'll just show it."
"4191510","4193010"," We'll fucking make it crayons. "
"4194010","4195590"," This is the previous high right here."
"4196970","4203410"," First scenario is where you fail to make a new high, and you actually just begin to go down and"
"4203410","4205270"," retest these previous lows, okay?"
"4207070","4213270"," This scenario, likely and historically, does not end right there."
"4214190","4216270"," You actually have to find a new low. "
"4217090","4217970"," It's very common, okay?"
"4219230","4222170"," Very, very common if you fail to make the new high."
"4225240","4231640"," Now, scenario number two is where, now, even with this failure, you actually go up there and make"
"4231640","4233800"," that new high, okay?"
"4234080","4234680"," You get above it."
"4236000","4239740"," Now, what we do from this point here, right, is two fold. "
"4240340","4241440"," This is the touch and go."
"4241660","4244720"," You touch and you go to new highs."
"4245980","4249460"," The second scenario here is you get the new high and you don't do the touch and go. "
"4249460","4253540"," So, you actually reject and you only retest this previous low."
"4254020","4254980"," You actually don't retest."
"4255140","4257020"," You actually run above it. "
"4257700","4259140"," And then you're off and running."
"4260220","4263020"," This is the whole, like, trough scenario here, right?"
"4263180","4263600"," You get the trough."
"4264260","4265020"," You break above it. "
"4265340","4266080"," Boom, you're gone, right?"
"4268600","4271760"," So, those are the kind of scenarios you have in front of you, okay?"
"4273920","4276820"," So, right now, these bears are telling you, you failed to get the new high."
"4276820","4282920"," That leads to not only the retest down here, but new lows needing to be found."
"4283340","4287160"," Now, there's a front running action to this happening right now. "
"4287320","4287860"," There's an expectation."
"4290180","4291260"," There's an expectation."
"4293640","4296020"," For next year here, here's December. "
"4302170","4303850"," There's December right there, right?"
"4304010","4304570"," There's an expectation."
"4306090","4311550"," You're going to have your February low over here somewhere and your April low somewhere over here,"
"4311670","4311810"," right?"
"4312370","4315110"," There's an expectation, well, fuck it, let's get it on right now."
"4315290","4318590"," Or even if you're going to get up there, you're still going to get down there and see that in"
"4318590","4321090"," that time period, right?"
"4322670","4329630"," And this whole idea here is they either get it going right now or when does it happen, right?"
"4329850","4332030"," Does it happen after January?"
"4332750","4337090"," Does it become something where you have your holiday rally, failure, right?"
"4337090","4339470"," To get that new high into January and February. "
"4340810","4346770"," And then you actually see that that down quarter and fit in the February bounce, April bounce."
"4347430","4348570"," And then we're off and running."
"4348930","4354970"," And then there's a bigger fear here that if we don't get that new high, that even in January and"
"4354970","4362550"," April, you would see another failure and 2024 would be fucking ugly, like straight up ugly to the"
"4362550","4363570"," downside over here. "
"4363570","4365470"," You can kiss all that shit away."
"4365890","4370930"," Without that new high up here, you can kiss the bounce and go in springtime."
"4371550","4375010"," Now, there'll be a front, there's an attempt at front running this right now, right?"
"4375170","4375510"," You see it. "
"4375950","4380730"," You can see the attempt at front running this and that's what they don't want to front run and get"
"4380730","4381910"," squeezed out, right?"
"4382850","4387170"," And then actually have it happen and then you're off and running up into the right."
"4387170","4392610"," So my first caveat on, hey, you should be good to go from here."
"4393950","4396650"," I guess you could say, yeah, you're good to go here. "
"4397210","4399010"," But where is here and where does it end?"
"4399490","4401050"," Does it end in December or whatever?"
"4402410","4404770"," And I don't know what to say to you on that."
"4411880","4419100"," Leave that right there."
"4425180","4427480"," This is where the second caveat comes in. "
"4427760","4435760"," The second problem that I have right now is some of these tickers are set up to sell the news,"
"4435760","4436180"," right?"
"4436560","4438320"," So you saw it in financials."
"4438660","4443560"," I'm seeing it in Google, I'm seeing it in Amazon, I'm seeing it in Apple, I'm seeing it in these"
"4443560","4445480"," companies that should not be there."
"4446100","4451880"," Like there should be, there should be like this idea that we can run up into December and I'm not"
"4451880","4454500"," seeing that in this earning season. "
"4455080","4460480"," I'm not seeing like, hey, I'm not seeing it in social media."
"4460720","4461340"," I'm not seeing it."
"4461920","4465460"," I'm seeing some of the analysts say it, but I'm not seeing it where the people are like, hey, you"
"4465460","4465740"," know what?"
"4466120","4468100"," We sold down into this ER season. "
"4468640","4472960"," You should be buying all these fucking companies on a low and holding them into end of year."
"4474160","4479860"," And hey, we're expecting like, whatever low we have in springtime or late winter is going to be"
"4479860","4483540"," higher than the lows that you've seen in this correction in the fall."
"4484080","4485580"," Like not seeing any of that stuff. "
"4485820","4491100"," There's a lot of like, you know, and then you get the banks trying to front run this whole entire"
"4491100","4492080"," move in 2024."
"4494080","4495980"," You get the fucking Fedtown."
"4496000","4497280"," You're going to go higher for longer. "
"4497280","4499800"," And I'll like to show you five year, 10 year charts."
"4500460","4505060"," You know that, you know, it's hard."
"4505260","4506100"," It's hard to say. "
"4507960","4510100"," You're like a temper the bullishness maybe."
"4511720","4512640"," Those are my fears."
"4512900","4513900"," I guess if I had bears, that's. "
"4517320","4518980"," Can Bitcoin be similar?"
"4520020","4523160"," Yeah, absolutely."
"4523620","4523720"," Fuck."
"4523880","4523900"," Yeah. "
"4523900","4525260"," Yeah, Bitcoin can be similar."
"4525580","4531840"," So, like when you look back on these mechanics, if we look back on this in three years, five years,"
"4532660","4535260"," it'll be all, you'll see all these mechanics will play out."
"4535600","4537840"," It'll be an expectation that these mechanics play out. "
"4538940","4544500"," The only way that they wouldn't play out or the whammy would be that Jerome is not lying."
"4545320","4552200"," If Jerome is not lying, if Jerome is serious and the banks are wrong, right?"
"4554480","4560260"," You will actually see a grind sideways and continuation to the upside for could be years."
"4560960","4566020"," You could see like a dead, not a dead market, but like a like a like a slow grind up"
"4566020","4568860"," sideways and up for multiple years. "
"4568900","4570940"," One, two, three, four, five years."
"4570940","4574780"," Like a lost like a lost market for."
"4576060","4577760"," That's the that's the Volcker scenario. "
"4577760","4581160"," That's a 1960s, 1970s type scenario."
"4581360","4582060"," You just keep grinding."
"4582440","4583120"," You have a pullback. "
"4583160","4583760"," You have a correction."
"4583780","4584240"," You grind."
"4584820","4585980"," You pull back in a correction. "
"4588020","4589260"," I don't know."
"4589360","4590500"," I don't know if that happens."
"4590500","4591600"," That scenario happens. "
"4592160","4594040"," I don't trust the politics."
"4594700","4597480"," I don't trust the greed that people have."
"4597480","4602200"," I don't trust the greed of banks to force that that that. "
"4602200","4603820"," Hey, let's go back down there again."
"4605160","4612400"," But all these mechanics at play right now are condensing in time like time is burning, right?"
"4613100","4617240"," Time is burning like time was going against the bears and and late 2022."
"4617780","4622460"," The fed was fucking the bears with time and right now the bulls are starting down a path. "
"4623260","4625720"," They're beginning their journey of payment."
"4625960","4627200"," Time's not on your side, brother."
"4628180","4634060"," So, you know, the bears, the bulls don't have a lot of time for this stuff to play out next"
"4634060","4634340"," year. "
"4634480","4638940"," So, I don't know like I have mixed feelings on it."
"4639040","4642260"," If you're saying till the middle of the or being in November, I think that's fine."
"4643380","4644160"," Middle of November. "
"4644460","4644860"," That's fine."
"4645140","4645300"," But."
"4649320","4650920"," Yeah, it's a tough one right now. "
"4651300","4653060"," It's a tough one to see right now."
"4656000","4656680"," Christmas play."
"4658080","4660760"," Brian sideways and up into the question. "
"4661040","4661440"," You want to see it?"
"4661580","4662060"," I'll show it to you."
"4662140","4662860"," You want to see the Christmas play?"
"4663200","4663900"," I'll show it to you right now."
"4664560","4665120"," Hold on here. "
"4665300","4666180"," I'll show you the Christmas play."
"4667400","4668740"," I posted it yesterday."
"4672020","4672700"," Well, here. "
"4675180","4677480"," They posted without you even seeing it, didn't I?"
"4677700","4678320"," Right here."
"4684190","4686030"," In a second here, I'll show you guys."
"4694240","4695040"," It's right here. "
"4695380","4697280"," Man, this isn't this isn't too hard to see, right?"
"4697820","4699060"," I put a bumper on this."
"4700860","4703580"," This new fucking image thing sucks."
"4710680","4712560"," Okay, so watch this right here. "
"4712680","4712800"," Okay."
"4713660","4715200"," On this markup right here."
"4715840","4718940"," So you got your first low right here, first low right there. "
"4719320","4721880"," You're coming into your next low right now, right?"
"4722540","4725640"," So you should be coming in here, right?"
"4725800","4729620"," And trying to buy this like tall spreads in here, right?"
"4730620","4732420"," Then you got your you got your little bit."
"4732500","4736420"," You like this probably December 1st or something like that."
"4736420","4740380"," And then you'll have a zero date play into the third not zero yet. "
"4740700","4743620"," Personally, I believe that's zero dates in the end of year."
"4744460","4748860"," But right now you should be buying like tall spreads for your for your holiday rally."
"4749080","4749780"," Do you see it right there?"
"4750540","4751680"," Fair fairly simple, right?"
"4752340","4756000"," Now, what is this expectation here into end of year is a big question mark. "
"4758060","4760200"," You just do like something that's in the money."
"4760200","4761700"," Is it something where you do it in the money?"
"4762120","4762800"," Where are we at?"
"4763000","4768580"," That's 4.22. Do you guys see this right here?"
"4768620","4769000"," I'm receiving it."
"4769940","4770340"," Cancel?"
"4770900","4771220"," No, no. "
"4771860","4772580"," Yeah, cancel."
"4773840","4775340"," So here's your trade as a bull."
"4776160","4776880"," This is SPX. "
"4777100","4780140"," This is your end of the year trade that you should be putting on."
"4780420","4780460"," Okay."
"4781600","4791340"," So and you've got, you know, the main concern for me is even though that's set up to do,"
"4793080","4796860"," even though we're set up to have that trade, do you temper your expectations?"
"4797260","4799460"," Do you temper the results of those expectations?"
"4801460","4810380"," Does it get awarded in service of knowing that banks likely want to have a retest of that previous"
"4810380","4812140"," fucking low in October?"
"4812780","4815100"," When does that previous low recheck come into play?"
"4815240","4817020"," Does it come in play February?"
"4817420","4818320"," Does it come in play in April?"
"4818320","4820000"," Does it come in play?"
"4820240","4821720"," We already begun it right now. "
"4822880","4824920"," So it's like spread out."
"4825000","4831540"," It doesn't look so bad, but, you know, it's hard."
"4831840","4835760"," So anyways, if you're going to do your holiday trade, right?"
"4836040","4840740"," And the reason why it's a spread is because you're going to see that grind all through into the end"
"4840740","4841560"," of the year. "
"4843440","4844440"," Uh, TLT?"
"4844720","4849540"," Yeah, I want to see, yeah, like TLT and like, I fucking hate TLT, dude."
"4849660","4850480"," It's a bunch of fucking old guys."
"4851520","4853060"," I fucking hate that trade. "
"4853820","4854720"," I hate trading DIA."
"4855040","4855320"," I hate trading."
"4855600","4856280"," Well, I like SDAO. "
"4856460","4857720"," I like Triple Leverage TLT."
"4858260","4859160"," Triple Leverage SDAO."
"4859300","4863140"," That shit, I like that stuff, but I don't like like directly trading the Dow Jones. "
"4871930","4877110"," I got multi, I got just refresh the chat so I can hopefully see YouTube's chats again."
"4880750","4881610"," 1229, 434."
"4881870","4882990"," You guys want to look at him?"
"4883490","4884370"," Here's to look at him right now. "
"4889390","4892330"," Yeah, you're going to put a little bit of risk on there and they'll come, they'll get cheaper."
"4894070","4895270"," Not financial advice."
"4896830","4899670"," This is from this point forward, not financial advice. "
"4900230","4905230"," You can do it outside the money call spread and they'll fucking be dirt cheap and they'll pay a"
"4905230","4905610"," fuck ton."
"4906790","4908410"," And you don't have to hold them to expire."
"4908750","4910950"," You just need to directionally go on the way you want. "
"4911070","4914350"," You can also do a credit call spread and do them outside the money."
"4914530","4916750"," And if you directionally start ramping, you're going to make bank."
"4917710","4920650"," You don't have to hold them into the end of the time period and that kind of stuff. "
"4920650","4924010"," I usually, it's like a December 31st or something like that."
"4925190","4931770"," You're doing like a, you're doing like a, and I wouldn't do it like December 1st."
"4931850","4933130"," That would be like December 31st. "
"4934170","4939190"," It was me December 31st outside the money and you ride them up."
"4939490","4941810"," You ride them up and out whenever it happens, it happens early."
"4942290","4947730"," Every year there's a big fight about the Santa rally or the holiday rally they say. "
"4949430","4953730"," Every year they go, like every year the holiday rally is early for its late."
"4954170","4955290"," Sometimes it comes in January."
"4955850","4958690"," It's coming like this first week's January. "
"4959210","4960550"," So you might not get the dude."
"4960970","4963630"," You could even put it for like January 15th or something."
"4964750","4967550"," Just to buy that extra time in case it comes late this year. "
"4969710","4970930"," Extreme response advice."
"4971270","4972230"," You make it outside the money."
"4972650","4973830"," You can just let them sit there. "
"4973830","4975170"," Mark goes against you."
"4975170","4978070"," He comes back and swings eye and takes it out."
"4978070","4979710"," Well, that takes right dot com. "
"4983310","4985590"," But every year we kind of, not every year."
"4985750","4987850"," We have had a, we've had a few in my recent number two."
"4988010","4990270"," I think we'll have two bad ones that I can remember, but. "
"4991470","4995250"," And then it becomes shit talked about for the next two months, right?"
"4995790","4997410"," You know, shit talking holiday rallies."
"4997830","5002530"," If you are in that trade too, the cool part is you can fuck around with people."
"5003650","5004390"," On the internet. "
"5007110","5011210"," Because if you're like, if you're in the trade, you're like, when's the holiday rally starting?"
"5014810","5016810"," And then you do the holiday rally shit."
"5017190","5019350"," You like, you like, you like fucking with your friends."
"5019610","5021570"," Like even if you don't like each other, you just fuck with each other. "
"5022470","5024630"," You know, when the fuck is the holiday rally starting?"
"5024970","5027370"," I was told there'd be a holiday rally, you know."
"5029090","5030310"," It's like a part of the year, man."
"5030410","5031230"," It's like a part of the tradition. "
"5035130","5037590"," Sparky, you know all about the holiday rally, dude."
"5038090","5039410"," Sparky, you get involved in the."
"5039550","5041510"," So Sparky just commented, right?"
"5042330","5044430"," He fucking knows all about the holiday rally. "
"5044590","5047190"," He gets all involved on, on, on fin to it with it too."
"5047590","5049950"," I've seen you talk about the holiday rally in past years."
"5050630","5051770"," I know you, bro. "
"5063430","5067250"," And that's what you, the cool part is you get to stir the shit pot on it."
"5067710","5070690"," You know, the people who like to haul it, you're never not getting the holiday rally."
"5071050","5072310"," People will be like, I'm the Grinch this year. "
"5072390","5074290"," You're not getting the holiday rally."
"5078570","5084090"," So rocks PM Sudanese says that foreign oil companies operating in the Kurdish region are informed"
"5084090","5090070"," that informed us that if an agreement is reached on all production costs and contracts, they will"
"5090070","5091870"," resume oil production within a month."
"5095970","5097490"," Holiday rally, bro. "
"5098030","5099330"," We got the holiday rally coming."
"5103170","5108070"," On that note too, on that note, if you are a."
"5111550","5112970"," The holiday rally, dude."
