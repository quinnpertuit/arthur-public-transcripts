"780","3800"," Check, check, one, two, one, two."
"5120","5860"," Oh, yeah."
"6880","9140"," It sounded like shit today. "
"9480","10400"," I guess it was bad."
"12640","13700"," I think it's still today."
"15480","16560"," Let's get in the way. "
"33760","35200"," It's true."
"47440","57220"," Check, one, two, there we go."
"61120","62200"," Good morning. "
"62520","66780"," We'll get right into it this morning as you saw sell off before the open."
"68460","69960"," Give me one quick second here, though."
"70060","72280"," I got a couple things I got to do so I'll leave this up for you. "
"73140","74200"," Hold on one second."
"77060","80140"," Put it down here for you right there."
"80660","81120"," One minute. "
"84260","88740"," So we did get the, we did come over by the way."
"89100","92220"," I got to tell you guys that I'm pretty sick here."
"92420","95400"," So I'm still violently ill. "
"95580","97480"," Actually worse today than yesterday."
"99020","101740"," You'll be looking to sell this five minute up here."
"101800","107240"," Just keep your eyes on this, on this cell zone above here. "
"108540","110680"," One quick second right in there."
"112520","115260"," We'll see if that rejects to the downside or not."
"116400","117760"," Just up in here. "
"119760","121000"," Looking for more downside."
"122020","122840"," We want a quick second."
"123020","124260"," I got to do one quick thing in the background. "
"126060","126760"," No, it's all right."
"126880","127400"," Don't worry about it."
"127660","133160"," No, there's some real concern for the market right where we are. "
"133160","133920"," So we're going to go over that."
"134600","137020"," And I'm doing a bunch of shit with some devs right now."
"137020","139000"," So I'll be here all morning. "
"139000","140980"," Just give me a second to work quick though."
"142540","143660"," Real quick here."
"144240","146880"," I just want to apologize to you because I'm worse. "
"147340","150420"," I think I'm not like in the sleep in phase."
"150840","158140"," Now I'm in the sweating and not sleeping phase or some shit like that."
"158380","159260"," I don't know what it is. "
"160380","161660"," Took two COVID tests."
"162780","164100"," Well, no COVID."
"166840","168940"," Let's see if that one quick second. "
"171220","173320"," Let's see if this gets a rejection up here."
"174560","176920"," And we're going to take a look at some big things this morning."
"177140","179800"," So yesterday, we went quick second. "
"180000","181520"," I just got to get this stuff done."
"182180","183000"," It's a pain in the ass."
"183480","185400"," Like YouTube is one of the. "
"187480","188320"," What is this?"
"193240","194060"," All right."
"195020","196320"," YouTube is one of the most archaic."
"196780","199820"," It's like it was like built like two decades ago. "
"200580","207220"," And when you live stream using anything in the background, it's just a disaster."
"207760","208480"," It's clunky."
"208600","209140"," It doesn't work. "
"210700","213800"," And it has all these extra steps."
"213800","221360"," And then of course, Twitch and YouTube want to slap by each other for who's in control of the"
"221360","221640"," stream."
"223060","224400"," Give me one quick second here. "
"224560","227620"," Okay, so just a quick brief on."
"229360","232280"," Let's go look over at the quick second here."
"233460","237900"," So on the clothes yesterday, I still want them. "
"238440","239740"," They're burning right now."
"239860","242460"," They're only worth a fucking four cents right now."
"242540","243040"," They were five. "
"244020","247640"," So I bought this clothes yesterday here."
"248040","250240"," Didn't not a ton like 25 contracts."
"251140","255860"," But we talked about that clothes that there's a high probability. "
"257019","261040"," If we hit that hourly and daily trigger that they'll sell it down, right?"
"261320","262900"," Boom, that's what they did this morning."
"263800","265960"," We got up into that daily trigger."
"266360","268680"," And it was an auto cell straight to the depths of hell. "
"268680","276160"," Now, saying that right there, I'm sure some of you are going to say it was yields."
"278120","280580"," It was yields that did it."
"280760","285420"," I'm like, I don't we're we're kind of set up for this already, right?"
"285620","288740"," We have a bear plane that already formed. "
"289740","291400"," I'll show that to you really quick."
"294800","301820"," So I guess they would have I guess that some magical beast out there and I guess some magical beast"
"301820","302820"," out there."
"307380","312220"," Anticipated the highest yield since 2006, whenever it was, but you can see it right here. "
"312820","314400"," Here's the bear plane right here."
"315040","321840"," And you can actually see the rejection this morning to the downside kind of anticipated, right?"
"322320","328260"," And what else is fascinating about this is when I take you back really quick and just show you want"
"328260","330300"," to show you a couple other charts here."
"330340","340340"," So this morning before we sold off early this morning, I woke up because of"
"340340","344880"," Disney and I'm going to go back and show you these charts elsewhere. "
"345380","349200"," But I was like, yeah, Disney's probably ready to sell."
"350600","353840"," So I took a look at Disney before it began to sell this morning."
"355300","359820"," And it's pretty violent move down for Disney. "
"361940","364580"," That's quite the dramatic drop, right?"
"364820","365280"," For Disney."
"365780","368560"," And you can actually see it yesterday."
"369180","374820"," A price getting underneath the crossover yesterday is a 15 minute chart. "
"375360","379740"," But you can see that they blasted Disney down pretty pretty violent move right there, right?"
"380120","383580"," Yeah, this is all in the matter of about an hour before pre market this morning."
"384620","391240"," But what fascinated me about Disney this morning was that I was originally looking at decidow."
"392360","396360"," And now, you know, they say the market can't anticipate the stuff. "
"396580","397340"," But of course, it does."
"398180","404860"," And estow on an hourly chart is extremely bullish."
"405220","407600"," Had a bullish cross into the close yesterday. "
"408660","410060"," You can see it right here."
"410780","413460"," And it was screaming up this morning."
"413460","417520"," It just bounced confirm and then blasted north right here. "
"417620","420880"," There are some sellers currently on estow."
"422780","425560"," But it looks pretty bullish to me."
"425640","427800"," If I don't know if you trade estow or not. "
"428520","430860"," But this is looking pretty bullish to me, right?"
"431000","434520"," You get the double bottom here and estow one right there, one right there."
"435100","440140"," And you have the confirmation, you've got sellers trying to pound this down."
"440720","447160"," But all it does is create that that pressure to squeeze, right?"
"447660","448980"," Just squeeze up higher. "
"449800","453580"," And so right we are right now, it's looking pretty bullish, right?"
"454220","456220"," This is a four hour super trend."
"456880","459820"," Whatever you're on, a four hour trend to the upside."
"460940","462740"," It's pretty it's dangerous, right?"
"463560","468680"," These trends can last for weeks, believe it or not, on four hour time frames. "
"469340","472220"," Sometimes just days depending upon the price action."
"472220","475200"," But it's looking pretty bullish here, right?"
"475400","478220"," So we're going to keep an eye on estow."
"478660","486700"," And I'm actually a surprise at this action, heading into a rate decision. "
"487020","490740"," I mean, this most rate decisions have muted up and down."
"490940","492500"," You get a little you get squeezes and stuff."
"492620","494040"," We're in negative gamma right now, too. "
"494500","497020"," So you're going to expect big moves up and down."
"497020","500560"," But this action passed three or four sessions."
"501660","503480"," It looks different to me than normal. "
"503820","508500"," And not only does it look different to me, the rotation is bizarre, too."
"509160","510720"," So I went through sectors this morning."
"512080","515860"," And I've been going through them for the past two weeks trying to find out where all the money flow"
"515860","516179"," is. "
"516539","518780"," I know that there's money flow in oil and gas."
"519020","521360"," We already talked about oil a long time ago, Brent."
"521780","530440"," We're talking about it on USO. "
"531160","536720"," But it's fascinating right now watching the rotation by sector."
"537260","541920"," And as I'm watching the rotation, it smells really bad."
"542040","543040"," It doesn't smell good. "
"544960","547760"," So we're going to see me check this right here."
"549940","552720"," We'll see if they get this rejection up in here."
"553020","554460"," You guys can't see this right now, but hold on. "
"556240","557560"," Let's go back to the main chart."
"558340","559200"," Let's let this over."
"560320","564280"," But I do want to see if they're able to sell this straight down to the depths of hell. "
"564880","566060"," They've already done that."
"566380","570100"," If you look on the bottom chart down here, they've already tried to sell it."
"570320","572500"," So we drew this one in right here. "
"572580","575620"," They're already trying to fire this up to the downside and have more continuation."
"577360","580160"," Saying that about S Dow this morning."
"581840","589760"," If you thought we had blood on Friday, if you thought we had blood on Friday, this looks like it"
"589760","591160"," could turn into that. "
"591380","595440"," So somewhat worse than Friday possibly."
"595720","602940"," So now I don't want to scare you or anything out there, but I am going to recommend to you"
"602940","605160"," to keep an eye on S Dow."
"607760","610660"," And this is S Dow down below here. "
"611860","616900"," If you see any point, S Dow just start hammering and holding that that five EMA."
"617860","622060"," So that one minute 27 EMA anything like this and starts heading higher."
"622600","623980"," It's going to be a doozy. "
"624480","626940"," So we'll keep an eye on it and see what happens."
"628380","632880"," If there's a violent downside move, it's odd to me because I'm not expecting."
"633440","639880"," I'm not expecting the bloodbath or the payout that everyone else is expecting. "
"640140","643340"," 444 was the put wall."
"643500","645400"," We're trading 442 right now."
"646620","654460"," So either this is going to be where everyone loads up on short and puts and they pin this market"
"654460","663140"," so they don't print or you get real money selling and kind of waterfall puts coming in the market. "
"663420","670640"," So we'll pay attention to it this morning and see about this selling that's going on right now."
"670680","673000"," See how how bad it is today."
"673240","681500"," I'm actually shocked here that it looks this bad one day before a rate decision. "
"681920","684120"," So we'll find out."
"684200","685200"," Let me know in the chat what you think."
"685600","690900"," So this morning, I was looking at I was like, man, the esta looks like it's rated a fucking crash. "
"691440","694940"," The Dow Jones industrial average on no news."
"694940","701180"," So this morning, of course, when rates came out and they assigned it to rates before that even"
"701180","706420"," happened, it looked like we looked like we're headed towards a major bloodbath today."
"706420","709740"," So I'm not surprised. "
"709900","714060"," And of course, they're not surprised and it's being assigned to rates."
"715860","716300"," Morning."
"716420","717280"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"721280","727400"," Yeah, Nvidia is now down $5.14. Nvidia blasting down off the open this morning. "
"727520","728340"," There's Nvidia's start."
"729960","734260"," I didn't really extend a lot of secondary with crude up by one deliver barrel."
"734620","735960"," Give me one quick second here. "
"736320","737620"," Yeah, turn this shit down."
"737620","742330"," Yeah, one."
"742610","743770"," We turn that off too. "
"744030","745470"," Oh, sorry about that."
"748010","750870"," Now, Nvidia, let's look at that one really quick on the bottom."
"750870","754730"," I mean, this looks like V shape recovery right here, right?"
"756430","760190"," You get a little bit of extra blood for for a day and a Friday. "
"760450","761150"," Not a big deal."
"762130","763750"," Not too much concern here."
"764050","766710"," I can I sure you right now, we can look at X."
"766830","768710"," Okay, even buying it and buying it and buying it. "
"769090","771430"," The one dip down, I'm like, yeah, no big deal."
"771430","773570"," It'll bounce right back four or five days later."
"773570","778290"," It'll start rocketing higher and they caught all these bulls in here once again and they're looking"
"778290","779570"," to catch them again to the downside. "
"780130","785510"," So we'll see if this works itself out to the upside, but it has all the smellings."
"785870","790050"," It smells a lot like bad to come."
"790930","798310"," It makes me wonder too, if there's a pause on Wednesday, you hear people all the time say things"
"798310","800690"," like, you know, we get rate increase. "
"800850","801870"," You're going to see a mark crash."
"801890","802970"," Never happened, right?"
"803670","811610"," I'm always afraid of stuff like this because it lends itself to action during a pause."
"812410","816170"," When they try to front run a pause, it can be two months of downside, right?"
"816450","818110"," Maybe even more two, three, four months. "
"818810","822670"," And then you see the eventual cutting of rates normally at a bottom of the market."
"823350","825750"," So there is some setting up for this."
"826010","827110"," Can I guarantee it's going to happen?"
"827390","833910"," No, you want to see what exactly the Fed comes out and says, but this time specifically, sure"
"833910","840050"," smells like they're at least setting the stage for that to take place. "
"840650","846790"," Now, if they begin to set the stage for this to take place, every rate decision we have."
"847210","854260"," And I'll be honest with you I expect 25 BPS either this decision or later in the year."
"854560","855440"," So I'm on team. "
"855660","862180"," We get 25 BPS, but maybe they just start setting this up every time we come into a rate decision"
"862180","865680"," for that anticipated pause and rates."
"868320","870300"," I'm sick as a fucking dog."
"870520","880360"," It's it's so like I was on the I was on the like, can't or like needed like 12"
"880360","883500"," hour sleep, then like three hours a week, then 12 hours of sleep. "
"884540","889960"," Now I'm in like can't sleep, night sweats, pain, body pain, all kinds of crazy shit."
"890140","892120"," So I don't know, I don't know what the fuck is going on."
"895760","897200"," So we'll see what happens here. "
"897200","903780"," We'll see if NVDA rolls or not SPX down 11 right now."
"906360","909540"," We'll go back to to spoons over here."
"912120","914280"," Yeah, they're already bloodbath in it right now. "
"914320","916280"," They're already bloodbath in the shit down right now."
"918560","921140"," Try to hammer this bad boy down."
"923360","925180"," It's not looking good. "
"925520","926620"," I'll say that."
"927040","933980"," Now on another note here, the trigger screen right here just for you to take a peek at on a"
"933980","936740"," 30 minute basis still looks fine."
"939960","943260"," Try to hammer this down to a 30 minute chart on spoons. "
"944140","948780"," I'll delete that from the moment to see you can see it when they really want to break through this"
"948780","949000"," right."
"949240","950020"," There's like a bear."
"950900","953100"," I can't blame a bear like you're a seller. "
"954260","956460"," You know, you're like hammered down here."
"956720","957800"," You hammered down here."
"958060","959360"," You hammered down over here. "
"959480","960720"," You hammered down over here."
"961540","964480"," And you're hammering down right right now, right?"
"964580","970920"," You're trying to just like break underneath that upper trend so you can get that massive move down."
"971120","972080"," Hasn't happened yet. "
"973020","974500"," Has not happened yet."
"974740","981300"," Like we'll look at it right now, but you can see you can see this pin strike right there."
"981360","983840"," You can see this other one right here. "
"984500","987820"," And they're trying with all their might to sell this down."
"987960","990940"," I'm gonna this morning the first thought that came to my mind."
"991380","994280"," Sorry if my my nose is fucking blown out. "
"995480","998840"," My first thought of mine is like this is Carl Eichen over here."
"998980","999900"," Caring fucking teeth."
"1005020","1010060"," Probably Carl Eichen bent out a shape over the billions that he's lost this year trying to market. "
"1011160","1019460"," That was part of our discussion we had yesterday was banks being on the wrong side of the trade all"
"1019460","1020080"," year long."
"1020460","1026800"," And you know guys like this, they would love nothing better than a vengeance trade to the downside."
"1028660","1030020"," So we'll pay attention. "
"1030240","1031420"," This will see where it leads."
"1039000","1043900"," They're if it was fucking yields, why was that style already showing it?"
"1044800","1047600"," I'm not really a snap that line right there."
"1047700","1049960"," Got a price target to the downside 442 19. "
"1050920","1057300"," The second price target to the downside 441 22 already starting to bloodbath it down right now off"
"1057300","1057900"," the open bell."
"1059460","1065620"," So we just tagged that 440 just tagged that 442 15 just now."
"1066280","1071460"," It looks like it's showing 442 21 at another chart. "
"1072080","1073680"," See if we can get down there and just squeeze."
"1073880","1076100"," We go back to the one minute so we can get a better look at it."
"1077820","1083040"," Pretty close down there trying to hammer this down right now trying to get down there and bang on"
"1083040","1083140"," it. "
"1084200","1088140"," See if they catch the see if they can catch that 19 or not."
"1088960","1092400"," I said it looks like 442 20."
"1094480","1097300"," And then you're going to look for the next leg here in just a minute. "
"1098420","1099580"," Be careful here."
"1099800","1101220"," I'll give you another price target here."
"1101280","1102000"," Give me one quick second. "
"1103740","1105640"," Another nice little tag right here."
"1106980","1109980"," That's at 441 87."
"1111500","1115740"," You're looking for this full sexy down move right here. "
"1116620","1119820"," And then maybe another big old rolled to the downside over here."
"1120300","1122740"," If you need to be breaking 441 87."
"1123500","1132000"," 4197 for a"
"1132000","1140820"," true 1.97. Let me switch over really quick to the weebull chart over here. "
"1142560","1146000"," And then you got to target to the downside over here."
"1148540","1149060"," 4192."
"1155320","1156660"," Right there's your target. "
"1157520","1159400"," You'll see you can see it should keep going down."
"1166980","1169720"," Let me show the main screen here so you can see both."
"1171180","1173080"," And they sold this one right here. "
"1173280","1174800"," So you got that nice sell up there."
"1175620","1176860"," Right came right up."
"1177720","1179420"," Sold that like a bad boy. "
"1180240","1182840"," You've got another one more target down here."
"1183300","1186100"," We'll extreme extreme move to the downside."
"1186200","1187620"," Hopefully you can tag that one. "
"1191230","1192530"," Shouldn't be too much longer."
"1194450","1195230"," Bloodbath and"
"1195230","1205290"," spoons"
"1205290","1207210"," right now, 16 right now."
"1207710","1211930"," And you got to see USO this morning as well. "
"1212450","1216010"," USO just like ripped faces into that open this morning."
"1216990","1218130"," Into that pre-market."
"1227610","1229070"," Sounds like middle pause. "
"1229870","1233830"," Yeah it's um I was watching the rotation the past couple weeks."
"1234170","1238210"," And then this past week left scratching my head yesterday and stream."
"1238330","1242970"," I told you I was kind of scratching my head on the rotation that's going on in the marketplace"
"1242970","1248730"," because at the read right now is fucking bad across the board. "
"1250870","1252610"," And especially into a rate decision."
"1252810","1254470"," I'm like man this shit's leaking somewhere."
"1255430","1259610"," I would expect it after the rate decision like a bunch of blood stuff like that. "
"1260130","1268130"," But inside of the two days leading up uh it is it is giving me some cause for concern."
"1270270","1277990"," Blast keeps blasting down now trading 441 98 if your eyes down there and your eyes over there."
"1278230","1280510"," A little bit more to go down. "
"1280670","1281870"," I said would I give you a number down?"
"1282010","1283390"," At least even get a little more right right there."
"1283450","1284310"," That's what I want right there."
"1285010","1285510"," I got that right. "
"1286710","1287870"," I got that right."
"1288550","1291190"," Almost a pin strike real quick right here."
"1291290","1292750"," Let's see how that works itself out. "
"1292950","1297870"," So we got nice little pin strike right there on spoos banging on the door."
"1298450","1301230"," It's kind of it for you as a bull."
"1302150","1305710"," If we break this support here we bounce and break down. "
"1306090","1310110"," Next target to the downside is going to be 441 22."
"1310730","1315270"," I'm going to give you your next your next train here in just a second."
"1318140","1320120"," So something just like this. "
"1321400","1328680"," Maybe some consolidation in here and then it'll be nice to see that nice to see that second blast"
"1328680","1329100"," down."
"1329380","1332040"," I don't know if you get this all right now."
"1332060","1337120"," I don't know if you get just a big one big red bar down here but I'm going to expect"
"1337120","1337900"," that you don't. "
"1338460","1339220"," Maybe you do."
"1340860","1343420"," It's possible it just goes straight down."
"1346210","1350070"," Next target to the downside over here is going to be 441 22. "
"1351510","1359790"," So I'll draw that box right here in just a second right in"
"1359790","1361690"," there."
"1367740","1369620"," Just ripping right now."
"1385340","1387740"," Well in second area get back to the main screen for you. "
"1390700","1394980"," Blasting right through any kind of support down here at 441 90."
"1396000","1397460"," Just ripping through."
"1398320","1400820"," I would expect us to at least trade down here. "
"1402100","1407840"," Give back all of this move the entire move all the way down here."
"1411910","1413890"," Look at that blood dude."
"1414950","1415750"," And pinky. "
"1415870","1421150"," I don't know if your hair pinky but I called bigy this morning was like this looks ugly as fuck"
"1421150","1421750"," on this open."
"1422410","1423210"," Told pinky."
"1423270","1426350"," I said I think Friday is going to turn out to be not even. "
"1427750","1432950"," Not even a hold a candle to what today's probably got in the store."
"1434950","1437290"," Put that right there for you so you can see it."
"1439110","1440210"," Right there. "
"1442250","1444430"," Just blasting right through right here."
"1444670","1448310"," Might as well just keep on going right now right."
"1448630","1450010"," Like just keep on heading down. "
"1450010","1451170"," Keep on going."
"1451370","1452090"," Go down to S2."
"1452550","1453750"," Don't even bother here. "
"1457450","1459490"," Just keep on going straight down."
"1459650","1460070"," Don't even bother."
"1460230","1460770"," Don't even stop. "
"1460990","1462310"," Just keep on going baby."
"1463230","1464830"," Trade that 441 22."
"1471160","1473920"," I sold my USO calls way too early. "
"1474640","1486200"," What is going on with"
"1486790","1487580"," I don't know why."
"1489880","1490860"," Turn that off."
"1491040","1491820"," Turn it back on again. "
"1493120","1494240"," Try the chat again."
"1496320","1498220"," Now trade down to S2."
"1499220","1502980"," Trying to get that tag down below to 441 22. "
"1503560","1505040"," A break would be preferable."
"1506040","1508280"," Keep your eyes right here to the bottom of your screen."
"1509000","1512140"," You'd like to see a nice break right through this. "
"1513340","1516120"," Maybe hit that 441 and change right there."
"1516340","1517940"," 441 flat would be nice to see."
"1525320","1526900"," Blood in the marketplace baby. "
"1538460","1541220"," Coming into S2 right now to see you can see it."
"1550280","1552980"," We'll draw S2 in for you."
"1553120","1554260"," So 441 31. "
"1555820","1557220"," I guess a little bit higher than right here."
"1562090","1563510"," That is S."
"1569950","1571210"," There's S2 right there."
"1571330","1572070"," Move that out of the way. "
"1583040","1585320"," Do nice fucking selling today."
"1588540","1589660"," Trading 442."
"1591020","1593800"," Break directly below trend. "
"1594200","1595480"," Just blasted below trend."
"1595660","1596900"," I'm going to draw that trend line in."
"1599080","1600020"," One quick second here. "
"1608510","1612890"," Let's see if they can get a rejection right where we are or not."
"1615050","1616730"," And this will be the next one right here."
"1616990","1618030"," Next rejection place. "
"1619550","1620610"," But I think they fuck."
"1620750","1622930"," I think we fucking go right fucking through right there."
"1625350","1626910"," I think we keep reversing down. "
"1627070","1628870"," I don't think we're done going down like right here."
"1629630","1629890"," We'll see."
"1630790","1632070"," Bring that back over there. "
"1636470","1638070"," I think we just punched right below it."
"1648470","1649430"," It's a race."
"1649970","1653910"," The reason being given is rates, but it was already lined up. "
"1653910","1655590"," You could see it before they opened this morning."
"1656410","1660090"," You could see it with you could see it with Estau this morning."
"1660210","1660850"," We move that over. "
"1668550","1669430"," No, that's right."
"1670730","1671970"," It's not right."
"1672130","1672650"," Excuse me. "
"1673010","1673670"," I said rates."
"1674090","1674450"," It's yields."
"1675430","1676490"," It's fucking yields. "
"1677510","1685270"," The treasury five year yield rises rises to 4.504. Piousense 2007."
"1687610","1689350"," Or at least in my view, that's what it is."
"1693220","1695200"," Yeah, you got Canadian PMI. "
"1695360","1700880"," Then you've got a ECB coming out tomorrow with I think they've got I think I come out tomorrow."
"1701020","1706080"," I think it's I forget what's coming out ECB tomorrow, but we got ECB news too."
"1711100","1712040"," I'm flat right now. "
"1712140","1712740"," I already closed them."
"1713240","1714320"," I already closed puts."
"1714980","1716280"," I still have calls on. "
"1716840","1718540"," I close right here."
"1719660","1720960"," So I'm flat right now."
"1721260","1725620"," I hope I was hoping that we get one more push up and then the blast down to jump in"
"1725620","1728100"," some puts and I got I got left on this trade right here. "
"1728240","1730320"," So I missed all of this bullshit right here."
"1732360","1733200"," We'll look for more."
"1733440","1734820"," I'll try to jump back in grab some more. "
"1734820","1743010"," So we can get a pull up here and jump in for one more one more downside move."
"1753580","1756140"," Also have a Vixpiration tomorrow."
"1756280","1763300"," Another fascinating thing about this morning was that there was there's a giant gap on HYG. "
"1763540","1766900"," HYG is just leaving behind massive gaps."
"1767560","1770160"," We've got Vixpiration coming up tomorrow as well."
"1770900","1773600"," Maybe we can get that Vix up into tomorrow, I guess. "
"1773600","1774360"," I think it's tomorrow."
"1774500","1776920"," I think Vixpiration is on the 20th."
"1777680","1782700"," So we do have Vixpiration tomorrow, so maybe we can get that Vix up to like 19 or 20 or"
"1782700","1783380"," something like that. "
"1784880","1786800"," Apple bleeding down as well."
"1788060","1794860"," USO kind of holding its own NASDAQ in full capitulation mode right now."
"1801430","1803150"," Dixie holding its own right now. "
"1804450","1806210"," I got to check on Disney."
"1806670","1807310"," Hold on a second here."
"1809970","1811490"," Wrong one wrong one. "
"1811770","1821760"," Oh yeah, Disney's straight bloodbath and it once again trading"
"1821760","1823720"," 8239."
"1824440","1826480"," We're going to take a look at Arm as well."
"1827940","1831380"," And because Arm was kind of fascinating to me. "
"1832420","1834440"," Let's take a look at Arm really quick."
"1840480","1847400"," Yesterday on Arm we talked about not being bullish unless we're above $60."
"1849280","1853240"," And there was a dip buy to be bought yesterday on Arm. "
"1853980","1855740"," We saw this dip buy yesterday."
"1856880","1865300"," But we even said don't fucking trust it above, right?"
"1865300","1873800"," Now trading $53.88. Let's take a look at Arm really quick and see what it's going to tell us"
"1873800","1873900"," here."
"1874500","1876100"," Let's take a look at Arm on. "
"1880410","1881930"," You guys are gangsters, man."
"1882090","1887770"," You guys are like, well, if you guys have been trading Arm, it's been baller."
"1894520","1897760"," Let's take a look at Arm right here and see if there is a dip to be had. "
"1900680","1904020"," It's a nice little bounce this morning as well, just like yesterday."
"1905140","1907360"," Not so bullish here though."
"1907720","1912360"," So because of the market right now, I would like to see"
"1912360","1923260"," price hold 55.5. It's"
"1923260","1924240"," not even worth the trade. "
"1924560","1930600"," Like 55.5 to trade 56.9. Probably not worth the trade."
"1931620","1933680"," Let's see here, 55.5 to 58."
"1934420","1935640"," Not really worth the trade. "
"1935840","1943060"," If you're a bull on Arm looking for an intraday dip buy, I'm going to go with no on this"
"1943060","1943360"," one."
"1944080","1949060"," You're at 55 right now trying to make $3."
"1950180","1954380"," I'd probably like to see it break above 58 and change now. "
"1954940","1956700"," More than likely it's going to be 55."
"1957300","1962760"," So keep an eye on 55 bucks in the next couple hours and see if they can catch a dip."
"1963140","1967960"," But with how the market looks right now, maybe not today on Arm. "
"1968680","1972540"," Unlike yesterday and last week, not liking Arm here."
"1972900","1976580"," At this point, I'd like to see Arm get above its hourly trigger."
"1977460","1979520"," Just like yesterday, we said, don't trust this. "
"1980360","1984960"," Sell the half hour trigger and not bullish yesterday until we got above 60 bucks."
"1985500","1985920"," Right?"
"1986160","1986840"," That didn't happen."
"1987100","1988080"," Never went up there, right?"
"1988380","1989920"," So no, no dip buy there. "
"1991460","1997360"," And today looking at it from here, you know what, this might be the bottom."
"1997740","2003040"," It might be a little bit of a round to going on the hourly down here."
"2003180","2004460"," So you can see that right now. "
"2004800","2005920"," Start to turn down."
"2006080","2008180"," We'll keep an eye on it and see if it does make a reversal."
"2009160","2010740"," If you can catch a nice squeeze off of it. "
"2018170","2022570"," You can get back to about spoons on a one minute."
"2026880","2028460"," A little bit of a V shape here."
"2028940","2031800"," A little bit of nipple action going on. "
"2036210","2037350"," Still don't trust it."
"2037630","2039970"," If you're trying to buy a dip, I would not be buying this dip."
"2040850","2042250"," Let's see if I can switch this over. "
"2046100","2047699"," Arm looks good over here though."
"2048179","2049440"," Let's take a look at Estau really quick."
"2049780","2051239"," Yeah, Estau just cranking. "
"2051920","2053179"," So here's Estau."
"2054420","2058060"," Estau is just full on blasting right now."
"2061719","2063300"," Estau targets to the upside. "
"2065179","2067179"," You just broke through one right here."
"2069219","2071260"," Estau has just reached its first target."
"2072239","2081920"," Second target on Estau is 24-24 and then the next target for"
"2081920","2082540"," Estau. "
"2082540","2086500"," Now 24-37."
"2087000","2088239"," So we'll see if we can keep extending."
"2089080","2090440"," Don't be trying to buy calls here. "
"2090580","2094460"," This shit's going to, if you watch the bottom of the screen here, this is looking to just blast."
"2095380","2096840"," Like straight up blast here."
"2099190","2101110"," I'm trying to buy no dips out there. "
"2114330","2116050"," Yeah, I got nothing on seasonality."
"2116310","2118210"," I can give a rat's ass about seasonality."
"2118630","2119750"," I apologize to you. "
"2120050","2122370"," If I traded seasonality, I'd fucking lose."
"2123930","2126070"," I mean, I like to know about seasonality."
"2126270","2128270"," I can't like, I'm not going to shit on seasonality. "
"2129770","2134090"," But it's very, it's like cause, it's a casual relationship."
"2137890","2144490"," Right, so it's not, if I traded, if we all traded just seasonality, we'd be fucking rich."
"2148430","2150650"," Let's see if we can get down just a little bit more here. "
"2150890","2151930"," Break through this Estau."
"2152750","2153850"," Hold on one second here."
"2156110","2158110"," Yeah, I got nothing for seasonality. "
"2158830","2161550"," If you look at, if you look at it, it's weird too."
"2161830","2165230"," Like traditionally, we're kind of weak in the fall."
"2166550","2169810"," And I just looked at the last two years or no. "
"2170150","2173370"," Yeah, last two years have been outstanding, right?"
"2174210","2175650"," October 12th was a major bottom."
"2175810","2182450"," We just cranked and then we cranked and well, that's another topic too."
"2183210","2186010"," We cranked the year prior too as well. "
"2187410","2190670"," Any major bottom, it just ripped to new highs."
"2192110","2194690"," It's like the whole like, ah, this is this and that's that."
"2194810","2198290"," I'm like, yeah, it is and it isn't for seasonality. "
"2198370","2199130"," I mean, I like seasonality."
"2199330","2199790"," Don't get me wrong."
"2200210","2202910"," They're like healthcare this summer. "
"2203450","2206530"," Best month of the year is usually, I think it's July."
"2207590","2209310"," It didn't start taking off until afterwards."
"2210210","2212770"," After that whole like their best month of the year kind of stuff. "
"2213450","2214670"," I can't rely upon it."
"2218590","2222430"," Now, you know, if you had bought in healthcare in July, it'd be fucking broke."
"2222710","2224690"," So it means nothing. "
"2224990","2230310"," Like seasonality is not anything that I don't lend any credence to seasonality."
"2230730","2231530"," Fucking zero."
"2232390","2232830"," I did that. "
"2232910","2233810"," I'd be fucking poor."
"2234090","2234530"," Guarantee it."
"2234750","2236310"," So price action is king in my view. "
"2237370","2238550"," I got nothing for seasonality."
"2239010","2240330"," I'm sorry about that, but I don't."
"2246470","2251210"," I'm breaking through right now, trying to get through that S2, trying to get down there and tag it. "
"2252070","2254610"," Now tagging that red target down below here."

"4129640","4132200"," Let's take a look at, uh, S-style real quick and see what it's saying. "
"4137050","4139109"," S-style leveling off a little bit of 24."
"4139590","4142450"," 30, no, but it's likely not done going up."
"4142529","4144029"," It's likely one more move down. "
"4144910","4148970"," So 24, 37 is the target on S-style."
"4149050","4152790"," If you watch down below here, there's likely one more blast down."
"4153390","4153950"," Fuck me. "
"4160290","4161290"," Flat again."
"4162510","4164189"," Stopped out on calls here."
"4164430","4165970"," One more roll down here. "
"4166609","4169810"," To keep your eyes on S-style at home 24, 37 is the target."
"4170069","4172569"," It looks like it wants to go up one more time and get up there."
"4177180","4180120"," At least the call is only buying 25 packs. "
"4180979","4183500"," Not fucking 100 goddamn calls."
"4187569","4189630"," I'm being checked on by my family right now."
"4189689","4190109"," I apologize. "
"4191689","4194410"," My family is like, what the fuck are you doing?"
"4197600","4200780"," I stink of a, I can smell puke on my breath."

"4203680","4205020"," Smells like a child that's sick. "
"4209970","4211910"," And just flat hair hanging out doing nothing."
"4211910","4217250"," I've been waiting for S-style to slam into the upside there."
"4218150","4220350"," S-style trading 24, 28. "
"4226030","4230510"," I got a full cross on hourly trend to the downside of NASDAQ."
"4232590","4237170"," And you know, you got another target on, we got another target on S-style even higher."
"4241290","4242490"," 24, 83. "
"4252720","4255440"," Single of a 30 minute chart here on spoos."

"4266980","4268080"," One quick second."
"4268340","4269620"," I got to cycle through this here."
"4283820","4286880"," It looks like it wants the fucking bloodbath here. "
"4287320","4289420"," Keep an eye out here on spoos."
"4290300","4296180"," It's got the one nastiness right here and it's looking for a second leg down right here right now."
"4299910","4301910"," We're just getting started to the downside. "
"4312580","4314340"," Just getting started here."
"4315960","4318280"," I think we blast through this S3 like it's nothing."
"4318760","4319980"," We want to point one quick second here. "
"4348560","4350780"," 439.01, sorry for muting that."
"4353340","4360700"," 439.01. There, there's your STXL."
"4366660","4368100"," RRTX by I should say. "
"4376430","4378470"," Leave that down there so you can see."
"4381290","4383130"," Yeah, we're going to get a bloodbath here."
"4465490","4471310"," 439.03, 439.01. So yeah, it's like right there. "
"4487820","4489000"," 6 or minutes left."
"4490600","4492000"," Start another half an hour."
"4492220","4497160"," Look for quick bounce after the half an hour and then more downside to come. "
"4596440","4605320"," VIX for the roll on 14.79. They're looking to trade though 14.89. Next target after that is 15 "
"4605320","4607080",".55 on VIX."
"4639830","4669330"," Long 439.P. Man,"
"4669470","4676830"," I want to stay on them till like the close here but I don't know if they'll burn them down"
"4676830","4677610"," into the close."
"4680710","4687290"," You know what I don't want to see is what I don't want to see is this kind of bullshit"
"4687290","4687690"," here. "
"4691160","4692840"," Then this is like end of day."
"4692840","4696360"," I mean kind of nonsense like that."
"4707070","4709050"," Is there anything like this paying attention there?"
"4711250","4714050"," VIX has a little bit of resistance with currently where it's at. "
"4715290","4716850"," No, but it should continue to go higher."
"4718810","4719170"," I've got them on."

"5167590","5174230"," You'd need a break above 2437 to trade 2483."
"5174830","5175390"," Pretty big move."

"6356970","6357370"," Just heads up."
"6357490","6359490"," VIX is rolling over closing gaps to the downside."
"6502730","6504290"," You want a quick seconder guys. "
"6506310","6507570"," Alright, so I'm done for the moment."
"6508190","6509790"," Well, on spooze right now."
"6510450","6512670"," Take a look at the 30 minute chart on spooze. "
"6513030","6514510"," Big old bloodbath today."
"6515590","6517870"," Still not as much as Friday."
"6519710","6524670"," Still not quite the blood we were seeing on Friday, though there is a point here to look at. "
"6526610","6528150"," We are now underneath."
"6530030","6534830"," Hit this target right here already."
"6535350","6537110"," That target out right there. "
"6538350","6541170"," So just keep your eyes on."
"6542010","6544550"," I'm going to get rid of ask me one quick seconder guys."
"6545390","6554040"," I'm going to switch over to a full switch over to a full. "
"6554880","6556400"," What is going on here?"
"6569230","6571450"," So on trend."
"6571830","6574830"," Okay, just watching trend here."
"6575150","6590480"," I'm going to"
"6590480","6593380"," target to the upside here to the you want to stay underneath. "
"6594340","6600040"," It's 442.56 and then this 5MT down below here."
"6601340","6602460"," And S2."
"6603480","6605080"," You want to stay underneath as well. "
"6606460","6610780"," It's going to be about 441.31 in just a moment here."
"6613320","6617000"," For further downside to S3 and the RTX buy."
"6617360","6619700"," We'll look at VIX really quick too. "
"6621620","6625480"," And I don't do VIX on the charts that you guys see."
"6625600","6626840"," I've got it on another computer."
"6628280","6629820"," So we'll keep an eye here. "
"6629920","6633120"," The one thing I'm seeing here is like a second double dip right."
"6633380","6634260"," See this double dip."
"6634420","6635660"," You got one dip right here. "
"6635700","6636520"," One blast down."
"6637200","6639300"," Trying for one more right here."
"6640720","6643340"," So we'll see if the bears have this. "
"6644120","6645520"," They can get one more bloodbath."
"6646060","6650760"," Write more one more down to the downside S3 or that RTX buy."
"6654650","6656370"," It was a little bit of lag in the roll. "
"6656370","6658710"," It's mostly due to VIX."
"6660950","6663130"," Even on the sideways trade right here."
"6664830","6666050"," It's it's flattening. "
"6666110","6667190"," It looks good right now."
"6667210","6668990"," We're above the one minute trigger right now."
"6669190","6669970"," So if you can see this. "
"6671530","6672970"," We are above the one minute trigger."
"6673150","6674830"," We should trade this being above."
"6674990","6676130"," We haven't rejected yet. "
"6677290","6683490"," I'll trade that 441.50. Make sure the bears or the sellers want to actually sell us market down."
"6683490","6685930"," So if this candle here holds this red candle."
"6686950","6689510"," If this holds we get a green candle right here. "
"6690130","6691770"," Expect that move to the upside."
"6692150","6694410"," So you're to wait for the next candle that comes in right now."
"6695090","6696450"," And find out if we go to the upside. "
"6696830","6699750"," We'll take a quick look at VIX as well."
"6700010","6704830"," I think it's more just timed than anything for the rest of that downside move."
"6705450","6707650"," So let's take a look at the VIX really quick. "
"6715600","6717340"," Quick peek over at the VIX."
"6718660","6722570"," A little 15 minute chart here."
"6723970","6725730"," And just so you can see it right here. "
"6726470","6727810"," Start off this charted for you."
"6727910","6731250"," I haven't charted on another computer right now."
"6731890","6732790"," So I'm kind of winging this. "
"6732930","6734590"," But there's your first one right there right."
"6735450","6739270"," You've got your your first flip-flip here right reject."
"6740450","6744570"," And then need some help to get up there and tag these upper these upper targets. "
"6745970","6747010"," How do you do that?"
"6747270","6755590"," You need to get dip buyers down here at 1557 1423 just to get you over the hump to get"
"6755590","6757590"," up there and slam into that upside move."
"6758330","6760450"," So if this has a quick pullback here."
"6761270","6763090"," Then you're trying to get up there at the end of day. "
"6764410","6766210"," Now like that four o'clock hour."
"6766550","6773150"," You want to see this 1423 hold to drag the VIX up and trade that 1569."
"6773750","6775530"," It's a pretty big gap right here. "
"6775530","6784030"," So we'll switch back right now on spy and we'll take a peek at it on weebull first."
"6784710","6795310"," The idea here would be you either get it on the six EMA and VIX to get the downside or"
"6795310","6799510"," get it on that 27 EMA to the downside for the bears."
"6800250","6805390"," The one thing I will say here is if you are a bear you do not want to give up"
"6805390","6806090"," S1. "
"6806730","6810730"," So right here do not want to give up this S1 right here."
"6811070","6813430"," Do you see any kind of giving up of this stuff right here?"
"6813710","6814750"," Uh, hold on a second."
"6815690","6817350"," So this is a better time frame here. "
"6820070","6827130"," It's not S1 but in truth you do not want to be giving up S2 right here."
"6828050","6836620"," So this S2, I don't know why that's hidden but So this S2 right here you don't want to give"
"6836620","6837200"," this up."
"6837720","6843590"," So if you're a seller I'm going to show you exactly what you don't want to see. "
"6844890","6847490"," You don't want to see this squeeze up here, right?"
"6849010","6849770"," I'll show it."
"6849830","6850590"," I'll show it in green."
"6850850","6852230"," I'll make it I'll make it Claire's day. "
"6853730","6861980"," If you see this squeeze up here comes back down right here."
"6864760","6870780"," If this gets caught right here I'll fucking puke again dude."
"6870900","6873740"," I'm like what the fuck is with all this nausea. "
"6874340","6875740"," You don't want to see that right there."
"6878660","6880020"," So just keep an eye on that."
"6880640","6885380"," What you're looking for here is you don't want to see any of this action as a seller. "
"6885580","6893860"," You want to see this fail here and no buyers step in so you can have continuation of the downside."
"6896180","6903600"," Not so bad either if you want to see this consolidation here and then blast down to the downside"
"6904180","6906720"," It's kind of like the finger trap of death in here, right?"
"6906860","6909040"," You don't want to get caught in this in any way shape or form."
"6910020","6915860"," If you're going to sell this you want to get back in below that 27 EMA right here. "
"6915980","6920160"," So you got to wait for that 27 EMA to get back short again."
"6920500","6921620"," So we'll watch this right now."
"6927360","6929120"," I'm showing you guys are seeing that, right?"
"6929580","6929600"," Okay. "
"6936490","6939550"," So don't get caught inside of this S2 zone."
"6940670","6941470"," You're a seller."
"6941470","6942810"," Don't get caught in here. "
"6943070","6943830"," Hold on here."
"6944030","6945270"," I'm the wrong fucking thing."
"6948230","6949650"," I'm all like, don't do this. "
"6949850","6950450"," Don't do that."
"6950570","6951350"," Don't get caught in here."
"6953030","6959730"," You want to get caught short down here at least down here or something like that. "
"6960050","6960990"," Enter again right here."
"6961150","6963010"," Do not fucking don't fuck around in here."
"6967070","6968890"," So watch the squeeze take place. "
"6968950","6974150"," We're going to check right now S2 and just make sure that sellers are still in control here."
"6976910","6978830"," Oh, glad I sold those fucking puts."
"6979910","6983030"," Fucking things are trading fucking 12, 13 cents right now. "
"6983630","6986570"," I don't know how you fucking savages do puts out there."
"6993350","6994750"," Get these fucking sellers."
"6996650","6998190"," One more up here. "
"7003030","7005090"," Let's see if we can draw out on this one for you."
"7006990","7011310"," You want something like that right there."
"7017540","7019640"," I actually want more blood than that, baby. "
"7020740","7022980"," Want that bad boy right there."
"7024660","7027100"," By 1.30 in the afternoon if you can do it."
"7031100","7040840"," Here we'll make it 4 p.m. We'll give you some"
"7040840","7041480"," time in here. "
"7043620","7044720"," Time is that right there."
"7045280","7046480"," 1,400 will shoot."
"7046640","7047580"," You got plenty of time in here. "
"7047740","7048480"," It's fucking early, dude."
"7049040","7050640"," It's only 11.30 in the fucking morning."
"7052360","7054420"," You know, all kinds of time to be fucking around in here. "
"7058900","7060340"," Nice and early right now."
"7074430","7075810"," Try and still to the downside."
"7091360","7092960"," The VIX is continuing to roll over in a one minute. "
"7094320","7101580"," It's got some gaps to fill down below to 14.54. Get a nice squeeze here."
"7115250","7116150"," You got it."

"8054470","8058690"," If you get this kind of roll right here, it is going to be fucking ugly. "
"8059930","8062630"," They're front running some shit."
"8063190","8068250"," Right here, watch this right here on XLF."
"8069250","8071530"," You get any kind of squeeze up here. "
"8071730","8074710"," It looks nasty, right up in here."
"8075310","8079790"," And even right here, they can send this straight to the depths of hell, even like a fake out to"
"8079790","8082510"," the upside and then just straight blasting down into this close."
"8083030","8087830"," Close that gap down at 3440 on XLF, excuse me. "
"8088930","8091950"," XLF, we'll look at XLK and XLC right now."
"8092110","8093410"," XLC's been doing quite well."
"8100130","8102150"," Yeah, you got the double top right here. "
"8102250","8107690"," You got the double top, excuse me, the double cross right there."
"8107830","8110590"," This usually leads to significant downside move."
"8111170","8118790"," So into this close, that 165 down here in XLK does not seem irrational to get down there. "
"8118890","8121970"," You got the one and the two and then just a straight bloodbath."
"8122270","8124730"," So be careful about it."
"8124910","8128390"," Even if this does squeeze a swift reversal to the downside. "
"8129430","8131730"," So here's XLK in the bottom chart here."
"8136130","8137390"," You get up here, right?"
"8137490","8142390"," You get that squeeze up here and then it's just send it down into tomorrow in XLK."
"8142390","8145490"," XLF looking really sickly right now. "
"8146370","8151250"," We'll look at XLC as well and look at that for XLC."
"8151670","8155750"," Well, these are all dip buyers here, right?"
"8156170","8162110"," Buying dips, buying dips and then boom, coming right back down."
"8162290","8164170"," This is the way you get the capitulation right here. "
"8164750","8170770"," You panic all these buyers and you panic all these buyers and it's just straight to the depths of"
"8170770","8171270"," hell, right?"
"8171970","8173810"," And they go back and recheck that low."
"8174430","8177830"," That's 66.25 something like that."
"8178650","8181990"," And when you lose this, you go straight down to that 64 right here. "
"8183030","8188030"," And then a blast and straight through all this until you find new buyers down below."
"8188330","8190150"," So the setup is there to have a bloodbath."
"8190830","8193290"," I just don't know that it's at this quick moment. "
"8193530","8202850"," Maybe between 230 or so, 130, 230 in the afternoon and then you get that final bloodbath down."
"8203049","8207870"," So on the upside here, if there's any kind of like squeezing up and like that, it looks like it's"
"8207870","8209549"," going to get followed through to the downside."
"8215920","8217059"," So bears got it here. "
"8217120","8226580"," I mean, they got a pretty big decent, pretty big decent ability to send this shit to the"
"8226580","8227799"," dumpster."
"8228200","8232360"," As a matter of fact, looking at this right here, we are now breaking below trend."
"8232840","8234440"," So here's a spy right here. "
"8234680","8235559"," Pay attention to this."
"8235600","8236959"," I watched that white line right there."
"8237160","8245379"," We are now sitting below trend and you start setting it down this way and you're in a downward bear"
"8245379","8246540"," trend at this point, right?"
"8247180","8248620"," Just straight blood down here. "
"8248780","8254020"," And then you get down into 432 on."
"8255780","8260100"," There's that this weekly trigger down here is that 432 right up here."
"8260639","8264040"," I believe that's where it's at and you end up trading that right there. "
"8265680","8271500"," You go from being, you go from being buying dips."
"8271760","8277500"," Watch the down, watch the, you're buying a dip, buying a dip, right begins to roll down here."
"8278780","8280840"," Do you get that close down there, right?"
"8281200","8283540"," And it is on like Kong into end of month. "
"8284959","8286280"," 432 price targets."
"8287080","8296879"," The 432 price targets on September 29th as long as the bears can hold this"
"8296879","8297559"," right here."
"8298760","8301379"," They basically got to hold exactly where we are. "
"8301559","8304020"," Not exactly, but you know, roughly right around here."
"8304139","8305840"," So they got to hold all this shit in here."
"8308670","8310150"," We got the expiration roll. "
"8310389","8312969"," 441, 91 is what bears have to hold."
"8313889","8314830"," 441, 91."
"8315790","8319950"," Amazon up to 150,000 employees for the whole day. "
"8321770","8323150"," Yeah, so right in here."
"8324530","8327150"," As long as the seller holds this right here."
"8327650","8328990"," See that dotted line up there. "
"8329090","8330549"," As long as the seller holds this."
"8333370","8337950"," You're targeted by 29, maybe the first week of October."
"8338510","8341650"," You'll be targeting 432 to the downside. "
"8341650","8342469"," Don't count."
"8362540","8365200"," What are 432 puts for like middle of October?"
"8366860","8375620"," Oh, fuck no, dude."
"8376260","8378360"," They want $2 in fucking $60. "
"8378580","8380240"," That's just begging to be taken for a ride."
"8382740","8384219"," 432 is for like mid-October."
"8384440","8387980"," They're like $2.60. They're like buy them all day long, buddy. "
"8388140","8389020"," I'm like, fuck you."
"8391980","8394160"," $2.62 for fucking puts."
"8395120","8396360"," Yeah, you're fucking mine. "
"8408110","8416150"," I was just telling a buddy that I lost $130,000."
"8417010","8426450"," And I lost $90,000 on the Elliott Wave, the Bear Elliott Wave counts twice."
"8429090","8432630"," And I'll never, ever fucking do that shit again. "
"8432990","8434210"," Ever for the rest of my life."
"8434530","8435650"," That shit's ingrained in me."
"8443960","8446240"," Even if we go there, I'll never fucking trade it. "
"8446820","8447980"," Never for that kind of money."
"8448180","8449500"," Watch that shit slip away twice."
"8449900","8450560"," It just burned. "
"8452300","8455480"," $130,000 trade was down 40k in like a week."
"8456480","8457580"," That was even shorter."
"8458000","8459940"," It was maybe like three or four sessions. "
"8461420","8464560"," And like seven sessions later, it was just gone."
"8466340","8468660"," Like fucking 30k, then 6k."
"8468900","8471060"," I kept those fucking, I diamond-handed those fucking things. "
"8472020","8475120"," Two zero, literally zero."
"8477680","8478780"," Went to dust."
"8484050","8484950"," Oh, fuck, no. "
"8485110","8486270"," Are we down the depths of hell?"
"8486510","8487110"," Hell, no."
"8487410","8493270"," The depths of hell is like 432 to provide more time for further negotiations."
"8493950","8495030"," You want to see depths of hell?"
"8496230","8496930"," I'll show it to you. "
"8497010","8497290"," Hold on."
"8501370","8503470"," This ain't depths of shit yet."
"8506230","8507890"," There's depths of hell right there. "
"8508290","8510510"," When you already got it, you're a third of the way there."
"8513550","8514890"," So, it's right there."
"8515390","8520750"," Right now, today it's at 429.54, but it'll be likely be at 432, but it's having to get there. "
"8528380","8530040"," This ain't depths of hell shit."
"8531860","8535020"," And that ain't even, that ain't even really depths of hell."
"8535020","8535820"," That's just trend. "
"8536520","8538600"," It's bottom of trend going back to October."
"8540100","8545100"," Deps of hell would be trading below that 432, and then starting to sell from there."
"8545500","8546560"," That's depths of hell. "
"8557640","8563520"," Vic's cranking again, going back up to trade 14.89 right now."
"8567270","8569370"," H.Y.G. rolling over."
"8572330","8573510"," Dixie's still strong. "
"8574130","8578730"," Nasdaq sitting on its 27 EMA, looking to roll down here."
"8580030","8581730"," Put your seatbelts on, bulls."
"8582870","8584670"," Put your seatbelts on. "
"8587330","8589610"," Disney turning around to the upside right now."
"8589750","8591870"," Again, trying to get about its 129 EMA."
"8591870","8603910"," Okay, calls just"
"8603910","8605050"," bouncing around right now. "
"8614060","8616000"," Crashed on what's on there, bulls."
"8617940","8625310"," You can pull that up for them."
"8627950","8634930"," If you give me this RTX buy down here today, if you give me this one down here, I'll play"
"8634930","8636090"," you some bear music today. "
"8642790","8647270"," We already called it to continue down side off the bell, so you don't get bear music for that."
"8647410","8648570"," We already knew that shit was happening."
"8649410","8651450"," This shit here unknown so far. "
"8651690","8656030"," So if you can get that one down there and do that one down into the close, that's unknown for"
"8656030","8656310"," the day."
"8663290","8668870"," Between 25 basis points, hike and pause, which is better outcome for the market tomorrow."
"8669530","8676570"," You know, in my view on tomorrow's rate decision, I mean, there's some part of this that's of"
"8676570","8679490"," expiration, landing on the same day as Fed Day. "
"8683630","8686090"," There's like a, oh, see, I don't see hell at 435."
"8686650","8687870"," I see a huge bounce at 432."
"8688950","8690430"," I see a monster bounce down there. "
"8691250","8692890"," If you guys want to see it, I'll show it to you, hold on."
"8694830","8697090"," You guys are out of your fucking mind sometimes."
"8697850","8698470"," Hold on a second here. "
"8698870","8702530"," Even I know where the fucking bear count is on the Elliott wave."
"8703150","8703990"," Hold on here."
"8709370","8710610"," You want a quick second here?"
"8712090","8714390"," You guys got to know your fucking counts are. "
"8715390","8716250"," Hold on here."
"8717850","8718810"," Trigger screen."
"8724030","8726130"," Give me one quick second. "
"8726770","8728010"," Can you see that right there?"
"8728830","8730710"," I want you to see this right here."
"8733190","8734390"," Close attention, bulls."
"8737610","8740050"," There's your dip by right back in October, you guys. "
"8740230","8740550"," Remember that?"
"8740810","8741310"," Some of you do."
"8742210","8742470"," Right?"
"8742930","8743710"," Bam down right there."
"8744730","8745630"," Right back down a trend. "
"8745930","8746750"," See trend right there?"
"8750730","8752890"," Right now there is a problem here."
"8755510","8759090"," Let me show you where the problem lies here."
"8759390","8760610"," I'm going to get rid of some of this crap from it. "
"8760610","8761470"," So you can see it better."
"8764810","8765690"," Okay, so."
"8768870","8770070"," Pay close attention. "
"8770490","8771270"," You see this right here?"
"8773830","8774630"," You're a bull."
"8775010","8776110"," Pay attention right now."
"8777490","8779830"," It's okay for price to come down here. "
"8780890","8782470"," Slam into that weekly trigger right there."
"8783230","8783870"," You got to see that?"
"8784930","8786050"," And continue higher."
"8786370","8791690"," Okay, so when you say like hell is coming at 4.35. Probably not true right?"
"8791770","8793070"," It's probably the end of hell coming. "
"8793310","8793750"," Does that make sense?"
"8795010","8796830"," So just watch that down there."
"8797190","8800110"," If you're a bull and you're like hey we're going to crash right there?"
"8800510","8801050"," Fuck no."
"8801870","8807410"," What a bear wants right there is the blast through or tag it right. "
"8808350","8812690"," You get the rip higher and then you sell down below that 430."
"8813870","8815030"," That's when hell comes."
"8815430","8818230"," So right there that's hell. "
"8819530","8821230"," Okay, that's hell if you're a bull."
"8822070","8823950"," That means thank you for playing."
"8824330","8826630"," Wrap it up for the year. "
"8828110","8828570"," We're going to talk."
"8828690","8831410"," We're going to bring this back into the fed hikes here in just a minute."
"8831550","8832550"," But just be aware of that. "
"8832650","8834790"," Okay, so if you want to take a snap of that you can."
"8835570","8837090"," You got 430 right there."
"8837250","8839030"," You'd see one big giant squeeze up. "
"8839210","8840530"," You'd see a rejection to the downside."
"8841110","8841690"," Whoop, right there."
"8842890","8843010"," That's it. "
"8843470","8843770"," What bam?"
"8844550","8847390"," Come back up here and then start ripping down to the downside."
"8847390","8850350"," Now that is trend over, right?"
"8851630","8853470"," This scenario right here."
"8854030","8855710"," It's not showing itself right now. "
"8855730","8856850"," I want to show you something important."
"8857690","8861230"," When you get this tool I want you to see something very important here."
"8862250","8869370"," So even though price is stretching to the downside the daily trigger is not following it yet. "
"8870430","8872070"," See this daily trigger right here?"
"8872130","8874070"," It's not following price down already."
"8875030","8876430"," If this was happening right here."
"8877390","8881810"," This would be an early sign of the bull run being over. "
"8882070","8883950"," We're not seeing it just yet right now."
"8885290","8887590"," So if you start to see this price come down."
"8888450","8893110"," Into that weekly trigger and you see that yellow line coming down believe it or not. "
"8893790","8898370"," That yellow line crossing that orange line is no go."
"8898630","8900990"," Like that is big time no go."
"8902290","8904870"," It is skull and crossbones for bulls. "
"8905490","8911830"," You're going to expect a major down move like continuation to the downside big squeeze in there."
"8911970","8915530"," But still do not want to see that."
"8915970","8919330"," You're a bull and you see that yellow line go down there. "
"8919470","8921310"," We'll pay attention to it as time passes."
"8922530","8931370"," But that's the big key point for you is to know that trend is broken below that 430 4.9,"
"8931470","8935110"," 24, 4.30, 4.32, however long it takes to get there."
"8935970","8937290"," So pay close attention to that. "
"8938510","8939950"," Won't ever we get down there."
"8940070","8941150"," Whatever happens down there."
"8941570","8944230"," If price goes down and this yellow line doesn't meet it. "
"8945250","8949050"," Staying bullish on a larger trend cycle."
"8950390","8955670"," But for right now that 4.30, 4.30, 4.29, 4.32, whatever that ends up being."
"8956350","8959590"," Should be the bottom for you. "
"8959750","8964650"," So 4.35, yeah you're wrapping it up at 4.30, 4.32, you got another 20, 30 points."
"8965210","8968650"," They'll do it quick and fast in half a day or something like that."
"8969250","8970690"," Not not truly a big deal. "
"8973780","8979100"," Now this ties into this ties into the Fed."
"8979860","8981760"," Now this ties into the Fed."
"8981760","8984160"," Yeah remember, I want you guys to remember some. "
"8984460","8987080"," If you're a bull out there, right?"
"8987960","8990120"," We were just at highs back here."
"8990400","8991780"," Price is still right here."
"8992500","8995320"," There's a whole lot of crying for where we are right now, right?"
"8996280","8997740"," It's like we're here. "
"8998500","9000100"," And even if we're here."
"9001500","9003840"," All this is is sideways action, right?"
"9004160","9009020"," So be careful with the, you know, crash kind of shit nonsense."
"9009560","9013280"," You need to get underneath this stuff here to get your crash. "
"9013940","9014500"," You understand?"
"9016200","9022100"," The other thing too to consider in here is the Fed rate increases."
"9024300","9025780"," I won't do it right now."
"9025980","9027500"," I'm not feeling up to it right now. "
"9027520","9028280"," I'm feeling pretty shitty."
"9028700","9029920"," I'm pretty sick right now."
"9030060","9033340"," But I have showed it on stream in the past and I'll show it to you again. "
"9034620","9036200"," Not to, I can show it to you."
"9036320","9036860"," Give me a second."
"9037060","9037840"," I'll show it to you right now. "
"9037840","9038860"," Give me one quick second here."
"9041320","9042220"," Give me a quick second."
"9042460","9044140"," I'll run it on the somewhere else. "
"9044280","9045060"," Give me one quick second here."
"9046120","9048660"," I'll show you what I mean by this when I talk about this."
"9049320","9051740"," When bulls are always like, Hey, is this good?"
"9051840","9052360"," Is this bad?"
"9052560","9053300"," Any of that kind of stuff. "
"9053620","9053880"," What's bad?"
"9054080","9054340"," What's good?"
"9058490","9059690"," I'll show you guys something here."
"9062900","9063740"," 40 is six."
"9066560","9067220"," Right there. "
"9067780","9068580"," And then another one."
"9070240","9080520"," 439.04. And"
"9080520","9081740"," then second I'll show you guys."
"9083000","9085340"," What I'm talking about when I say it's not bullish. "
"9087000","9088740"," If they don't raise rates."
"9095750","9097330"," That's S3 right there, right?"
"9101980","9103560"," That's S3 right there."
"9104340","9106140"," That's STX by down there. "
"9114190","9116350"," I'm going to talk to you guys something real quick."
"9116470","9116890"," Give me a quick second."
"9117090","9117870"," I'll set it up. "
"9122190","9123970"," I'll make this really simple for you."
"9128470","9130230"," Actually, we'll look at cycles really quick."
"9137830","9139930"," Yeah, PMO is coming down to the zero line. "
"9140510","9142510"," PPO is coming down to the zero line as well."
"9149950","9151530"," I'm going to fucking hurl again dude."
"9151650","9156410"," I'm going through these motions of it's on a weekly chart. "
"9184960","9186180"," I'm going to bring this over."
"9186340","9186860"," Give me one quick second."
"9198040","9200640"," Okay, I'm going to click second here. "
"9201280","9203360"," Sorry, really all this shit looks wacky."
"9204880","9207080"," I'll try to adjust all this right here."
"9211890","9212430"," Okay. "
"9214430","9216530"," So they don't always time this right."
"9218330","9220530"," But I want you to see something here, okay?"
"9221330","9224010"," I want you to look at the front running."
"9225350","9228730"," Hold on, I got to slide this over for you so you can see it. "
"9229050","9233610"," I want you to see this cut, this flattening of rates here."
"9233770","9234970"," Here's the fed funds rate right here."
"9236050","9239390"," And when they finally start to pause, right?"
"9239750","9242210"," You end up seeing a front running of the market. "
"9243390","9243630"," Okay."
"9244470","9249950"," Another key point here is you'll start to see inflation go down, right?"
"9250770","9252230"," And then bottom, right?"
"9254010","9256950"," You've got the unemployment rate rising, right?"
"9257410","9259290"," Not quite there with unemployment rate, right?"
"9259430","9260990"," Now we don't get the quite the rise."
"9261870","9264070"," Tens and two start to rise right here. "
"9264350","9266050"," Kind of the same deal right here though, right?"
"9266830","9268290"," You get the cutting of rates."
"9268610","9271010"," When do we get the actual cutting of rates though?"
"9272170","9277770"," We get the cutting of rates always, right?"
"9278050","9279510"," Watch how they're cutting rates now, right?"
"9280610","9281370"," Panic cutting rates."
"9282290","9283370"," Panic cutting rates. "
"9283370","9284510"," We're still heading down."
"9284850","9286830"," And there's a front run to that roll."
"9287090","9287550"," Do you see that?"
"9287890","9290610"," You've got the damages done, right?"
"9290790","9292770"," We start to raise up on the tens and twos. "
"9295470","9298110"," And we've got inflation kind of bottoming, right?"
"9298370","9299950"," It's kind of a similar thing right here, right?"
"9300230","9302170"," Flattening right here, right?"
"9302350","9302990"," Are we pausing?"
"9303110","9303970"," Are we not pausing?"
"9304070","9304570"," Are we pausing?"
"9304690","9305270"," We're not pausing."
"9305670","9313570"," So what does that mean to you into tomorrow and into the next rate decision is if they continue to"
"9313570","9317630"," raise rates, you're going to expect the market to grind higher."
"9317910","9318310"," Does that make sense?"
"9319170","9320370"," Just grind higher, right?"
"9321290","9325950"," They were saying today about unemployment still being employment being robust. "
"9326890","9328710"," See that flattening right here?"
"9328810","9335550"," You got the grinding up of tens and twos, but not the full rip of tens and twos, right?"
"9336170","9341290"," We have a couple other times where they try to do the same shit, sorry for saying shit."
"9342030","9343030"," But right here, right?"
"9343150","9346650"," They're trying to time, trying to time that role, right?"
"9347490","9348530"," Nope, back up."
"9348670","9353630"," And then you get the big blast down, you get the huge spike on employment, you get the rounding up"
"9353630","9360170"," of the tens and twos, you've got the inflation rate rising, and then of course you've got the panic"
"9360170","9361270"," from COVID right here. "
"9361890","9363170"," It's kind of like get rid of that one."
"9363190","9366870"," Now if you start to look at this stuff, I'm looking at this on spy, but you can look at"
"9366870","9367970"," this on SPX."
"9372560","9377240"," And even see further examples of this in the past. "
"9378240","9383080"," You actually see the same further examples down here, right?"
"9383820","9385540"," Panic by the Fed to start to cut right here."
"9386160","9387660"," Same kind of a deal right here, right?"
"9387940","9389220"," Same kind of a deal right in here."
"9390700","9400500"," So if you're a bull, if you are a bull, history is not on your"
"9400500","9409040"," side, no matter what anyone tells you out there, well, there's more than that. "
"9409540","9413800"," There's think, it's multi-fold."
"9420670","9421950"," It's multi-fold."
"9422350","9432290"," So if you're a bull, right, your best case scenario, your"
"9432290","9441790"," best, well, that best case, your instant gratification, your instant gratification is"
"9444090","9445350"," higher for longer. "
"9446290","9452630"," And the banks to believe that it's higher for longer, that's an important part of this equation."
"9453430","9460770"," And banks will attempt to front-run a pause in rates to the downside of the market."
"9461790","9463250"," So they'll set this up. "
"9464310","9471210"," So if Jerome starts saying no or pause in tomorrow, and then you get a winter pause, he just keeps"
"9471210","9472490"," saying pause to you."
"9473330","9477850"," The banks will set it up to front-run, move lower in the marketplace."
"9479210","9481310"," Now there's some caveats here. "
"9483830","9486510"," So inflation has to stop going down."
"9486750","9489950"," We know that inflation is not where the Fed wants it to be."
"9490370","9496210"," Unemployment and the COVID business cycle is still not quite in line. "
"9496450","9503130"," We're not seeing, it sucks to say this because it's a mean thing to say."
"9503550","9509090"," It's weird, it's a hard thing to say, but the Fed says they have a dual mandate, right, maximum"
"9509090","9512130"," employment, lowering inflation."
"9512970","9519190"," But the truth is they're never going to tell you the truth that they want mass unemployment. "
"9520530","9527590"," And you know, for a guy that I don't agree with often and his timing fucking sucks, you think my"
"9527590","9531430"," timing sucks, man, is Ray Dalio."
"9531790","9534490"," That guy calls for like stupid shit."
"9535170","9539330"," And he's always been wrong in his timing, but his thesis is correct. "
"9540010","9546510"," When he talks about economic cycles, debt cycles, business cycles, and right now we've got this"
"9546510","9549690"," COVID, we have a normal business cycle, I'm going to fucking throw up here."
"9550070","9554310"," We have a COVID cycle, a business cycle, the Fed's trying to get back in line together."
"9555950","9565170"," So on a short-term basis, you as a bull want the market to believe and for the Fed president"
"9565170","9568730"," to buy as much time as possible. "
"9569990","9575270"," Before that role comes, I'm going to explain that point right now to you really quick."
"9575390","9578070"," I'm going to show you guys something really quick here."
"9582260","9583000"," Excuse me. "
"9586490","9590230"," Why he's trying to buy time for the market."
"9591830","9599130"," So whenever you get a stretch in the marketplace, right, whenever we stretch, stretch meaning"
"9599130","9608270"," prices up here, and we have a lot of stretch in here, we have high risk before a major crash"
"9608270","9611490"," to the downside, like violent moves down."
"9612910","9619470"," And as we began to come down here, the market believes the Fed is doing its job, right?"
"9620030","9622570"," They're actually fighting inflation and all that kind of stuff, right?"
"9623170","9627190"," So the Fed is arresting that violent move to the downside here. "
"9628170","9636150"," And when you look at that violent move to the downside, right, that target down there was 2,200, 2 "
"9636150","9638430",",400, 2,600."
"9639530","9643490"," And then down here it was 2,800, 3,200."
"9644010","9650030"," Mike Wilson was calling for 32 in September, if you remember, and he called for it, leading all the"
"9650030","9653150"," way up into the end of year, I believe. "
"9653710","9657470"," Don't quote me on the exact times, but I know that he was doing that at that time period."
"9657870","9659730"," He was actually targeting this right here."
"9660650","9662690"," That's why he called that number up. "
"9663010","9664390"," You can actually see it right here."
"9664550","9671070"," It's 3,000, and then in October, he said 320 or something like that, and that's right in this range"
"9671070","9671590"," right here."
"9672690","9673950"," So he made a good call. "
"9674490","9678750"," Now, the trick here from the Fed is what?"
"9679730","9686530"," The trick from the Fed is, the longer that they make you believe that we're going to go higher for"
"9686530","9694490"," longer, the more chance there is for all of these anticipated lows to come higher, right?"
"9695390","9703310"," So instead of having that nasty downside move, the Fed is hoping for grind it sideways, and then"
"9703310","9705250"," come back down, touch, and go."
"9706010","9715510"," And that's the thesis from when bulls say things like, well, the fucking recession is transitory,"
"9715510","9716470"," and we beat the recession."
"9717510","9725990"," This is their plan right here, higher for longer, draw it back down, and we don't see the scaries"
"9725990","9730490"," from 2022 ever again. "
"9732450","9738590"," Now, even if we do see the scaries and we break through here, not so bad, right?"
"9738970","9747310"," If you're a mutual fun holder, if you're a pension fund holder, if you're 401k holder, can't really"
"9747310","9748770"," complain about that, can you?"
"9749790","9753010"," Can't really complain about a higher bound still over here, can you?"
"9753190","9756250"," So the Fed still wants to do that, right?"
"9757230","9763670"," So the idea here being is, if you want that short term, if you want that short term, you want"
"9763670","9769890"," higher for longer, or at least the belief in higher for longer."
"9769890","9775150"," Now, if the banks try to front run that and say, this is bullshit, this guy's going to cut rates,"
"9775890","9781710"," or there's going to be an election and someone's going to win, and they're going to turn on the"
"9781710","9782910"," money printer again, right?"
"9783130","9792990"," Not the money printer, but basically the money printer, they will run it down for a much lower dip"
"9792990","9793270"," buy."
"9794310","9801870"," So heading into tomorrow's Fed rate decision, if you're a bull, you want to hear, even if we have,"
"9801870","9811770"," even if we have, hold on a second here, even if we have a weakness tomorrow from that 25 BPS,"
"9812530","9814870"," I would expect the market to be bought, right?"
"9815490","9821310"," If you start to hear the Fed president pause now, pause in the winter, pause in the spring, all"
"9821310","9825470"," that kind of shit, you know the cycle is over, and they're going to try to set this market up"
"9825470","9826290"," to roll it down. "
"9826290","9830430"," Historically speaking, where we are right now, it's set up to do that."
"9831370","9839310"," Now, if he gives you 25 BPS, there's your 472, there's your 480 to the upside, grind sideways and"
"9839310","9839990"," up for longer."
"9840870","9843550"," He's got other things against him as well. "
"9843930","9851710"," This election, it hasn't shown itself yet, but I'm anticipating, I don't know why you wouldn't run"
"9851710","9858170"," a candidate that was not that I would vote for this person either, but if I was a bet man,"
"9859190","9863030"," I'd be out there campaigning on the campaign trail telling you all lies."
"9863290","9866830"," I'd be telling you all that Ronald Reagan bullshit story, right?"
"9867670","9870170"," They're going to get this economy back up and running for you."
"9870350","9873970"," No, I don't want to bring politics into it, but this does impact the stock market. "
"9874710","9882590"," So you know that the Fed president doesn't know what his status is going to be, heading into that"
"9882590","9883630"," presidential election."
"9884210","9888630"," If you've got a bunch of people saying they're going to save money, but you know they're going to"
"9888630","9894070"," spend the I.E. Republicans, and if that's a story, like we're going to cut earlier taxes and we're"
"9894070","9898130"," going to do this and we're going to do that, a lot of voters will head into a voting booth"
"9898130","9899030"," and they'll be like, hey, you know what?"
"9899110","9901270"," I like these issues, but I pay taxes."
"9902850","9908210"," And I'll tell you what, when voters go into voting booths for president, and they have, we had that"
"9908210","9915910"," four years away from Trump, this election cycle or the next one at some point, voters will go into"
"9915910","9921390"," a booth if they can find someone that they can stomach a tablespoon of whoever that is. "
"9922350","9929390"," And there's risk there that this whole thesis, not thesis, but this whole like Fed drive will be"
"9929390","9929790"," over."
"9930590","9931870"," So he's not a timeline."
"9932070","9933370"," He's not a timeline in the spring time. "
"9933390","9937670"," He's not a timeline in the fall of next year into what he can get done."
"9939830","9943790"," I wouldn't say a timeline, but it's more unknowns, right?"
"9944390","9948890"," And so you got banks are going to want to try to front run this stuff if they think that"
"9948890","9953010"," something different is going to happen with our election cycles."
"9954050","9956810"," So if you're a bull, you want to hear that 25 VPS. "
"9957070","9963310"," If you don't hear the 25 VPS tomorrow, you want to at least hear Stern language and he's been good"
"9963310","9967690"," at this recently of threading a needle of hire for longer."
"9968450","9974850"," So if you get like really, really hawkish Fed president speaking, you get Jerome just like super"
"9974850","9980130"," hawke or something, something same comes out of his mouth, that might do it, that could do it."
"9980990","9983310"," I tend, I'm stopping to believe that. "
"9983510","9988750"," I think he has, I think he has, he has to raise 25 VPS tomorrow."
"9989030","9989770"," I think he has to."
"9990450","9995210"," Or if he's trying to roll this market, he doesn't give you the 25 VPS. "
"9995530","10001930"," I would expect banks to begin to start that front running between now and the next next rate"
"10001930","10002450"," decision."
"10002950","10006810"," Now he can raise 25 VPS next decision."
"10007070","10009070"," He might even tell you we're not going to raise rates here. "
"10009150","10011110"," We have a high likelihood of it, the next decision."
"10011650","10015150"," That might work for you to go higher for longer."
"10016010","10019950"," But the truth is it's sooner than later, right?"
"10020210","10022710"," Or it seems like it's sooner than later, right now. "
"10023310","10027750"," Personally, I want to, I want to see inflation come down."
"10028750","10030610"," But we know that shit doesn't happen, right?"
"10031590","10038790"," We know that, I think someone, someone made a post yesterday on Reddit that said, the US dollar is"
"10038790","10042750"," inflated 3000% or something insane like that."
"10043230","10047630"," You know, these people are greedy and they'll do whatever they can to make money. "
"10047790","10051530"," So it's a tough call here as a bull."
"10051530","10052670"," It really is."
"10053490","10054530"," It really is. "
"10054630","10057830"," And the crazy part here too is if we keep raising rates, right?"
"10058070","10063410"," You'll see this market with volatility good and bad with an upside move."
"10063610","10069250"," You'll see us grind higher, set it up again for a roll, grind higher, set it up again for a"
"10069250","10069490"," roll."
"10070310","10074110"," And they'll do that until we get that fucking roll until they know that we're paused. "
"10075030","10077870"," When that bank knows we're paused, they will run this market down."
"10078410","10079270"," So how far that goes?"
"10080050","10081530"," That's yet to be seen, right?"
"10081710","10087170"," That is the question about, hey, is that we pass a recession?"
"10087650","10089990"," Is the recession transitory or not?"
"10090610","10097370"," And you'll know by price, if that recession was transitory or not, if unemployment rates climb, if"
"10097370","10099510"," the Fed starts panic, cutting rates."
"10100630","10103330"," If you start to see the 10s and 2s, just start fucking ripping. "
"10104210","10110130"," And the two, the two best indicators that I've found, two best indicators that I've found that have"
"10110130","10112190"," been most truthful, not even the two's and 10's."
"10112850","10117550"," It's always the bottoming of inflation and the rapid rise in unemployment."
"10118430","10121350"," No matter what anyone else tells you out there, you can do this on your own. "
"10121430","10125670"," You go up and look up the unemployment rate, check it against the S&P 500."
"10126430","10130190"," And when that unemployment rate starts, just fucking screaming."
"10131130","10135750"," This market rolls every single, not every, it's like 90% of the time. "
"10136290","10138430"," That's why I don't like people calling out the 2s and 10s."
"10138530","10143410"," I'm like, add that thing's good for like 60% of the time, 70% of the time it's best."
"10144230","10146650"," You really want to see that bottoming of inflation. "
"10147270","10150790"," You want to see that unemployment rate just start ramping."
"10150970","10153350"," And you want jobs to start shitting the bed as well."
"10153930","10157650"," That'd be the only other one that I would add in. "
"10157790","10162450"," You want all those jobs not being offered, people getting laid off en masse."
"10162450","10170910"," And if you're young, when that happens, it is you will see it in your life."
"10171150","10176490"," You like right now as a young person, if you're seeing people holding down two, three jobs, or I"
"10176490","10177470"," don't know, they're getting paid enough. "
"10177590","10178830"," So they got to work 90 hours a week."
"10179010","10180510"," That ain't what I'm talking about."
"10181270","10185630"," As long as people are working, as long as people are paying their bills, I don't care about their"
"10185630","10186370"," credit card debt. "
"10186610","10188370"," I don't care about their mortgages."
"10188490","10190550"," I don't care where the housing market's headed."
"10190550","10193670"," It's when they stop being able to pay their bills. "
"10194110","10196030"," It's when they don't have a fucking job."
"10196470","10198510"," These people that work like that, right?"
"10198850","10205310"," They will give up their house, they'll get divorced, and they will sleep in their vehicle to go to"
"10205310","10206190"," work every single day."
"10206410","10210210"," And if you've never seen that cycle as it happens, it is eye-opening. "
"10210530","10210830"," You're young."
"10211090","10212090"," I'm telling you, we ain't there yet."
"10212370","10216130"," When we're there, when we are there, it is not pretty. "
"10216650","10217950"," It is not not pretty."
"10217950","10219790"," Your wife's going to take the kids."
"10219810","10220970"," It's going to take the dog. "
"10221530","10223090"," It's going to take everything you have."
"10223830","10225130"," You're going to be living out of your truck."
"10225350","10231950"," And I'm sure you're probably, you're likely somewhere in that 40 to 60 year old range. "
"10233570","10237410"," And you're likely not going to be able to get the position that you want."
"10237510","10239370"," Let's say you get laid off, right?"
"10239750","10240670"," Job openings and unemployment."
"10241450","10243110"," Let's say you get laid off. "
"10243110","10245290"," Let's see, make 100k a year and you get laid off, right?"
"10245930","10247730"," And you go back to take a position."
"10248190","10253270"," They're going to be hiring somebody younger than you for less money than you're going to be fucked."
"10254190","10258810"," I've seen it three times in my lifetime, three times so far, like full cycles. "
"10259290","10260290"," And it's not pretty."
"10260750","10263530"," Anyone that tells you that it's pretty, it is not."
"10263730","10265090"," We're not there yet, you know?"
"10265290","10272370"," Maybe someone in this audience in the chat thinks it's worse than it's been in 08, 07 or 2000 or"
"10272370","10272690"," 87. "
"10274130","10278030"," Any of those time frames in the 90s, I mean, I don't know."
"10278210","10279150"," I've never seen it."
"10279290","10280390"," I don't see that yet. "
"10281750","10286890"," So I don't think they've broken the economy yet."
"10287550","10293410"," And so higher for longer, if he can get that across to you tomorrow, that it is higher for longer"
"10293410","10294370"," than he believes in that."
"10295090","10301450"," Or if he slams us with a point with a 25 basis points tomorrow, I don't see that as bad"
"10301450","10302370"," for you as a bull. "
"10308390","10310230"," So yeah, sorry for my fucking voice too."
"10311250","10313310"," Do you guys all understand these concepts?"
"10313670","10314570"," Please tell me that you do."
"10314670","10321490"," If you don't understand these concepts, get on trading view and start to look up the rate of"
"10321490","10327530"," inflation, the unemployment rate, look up the Fed funds rate. "
"10328430","10332530"," Any of those rates that you can check, you can go back using SPX."
"10332770","10338170"," You can actually use, I think it's a CYA or something like that to cover your own ass."
"10338970","10343110"," But the New York, you can actually go farther back to the 1890s. "
"10343410","10348850"," And it's pretty consistent as to when the market rolls over in a big way and how it gets rolled"
"10348850","10350590"," and how it's front run."
"10350990","10356930"," And then even when we don't, even when it's like a false start, we actually continue to grind"
"10356930","10360250"," higher until that takes place, generally speaking."
"10364810","10366150"," Let me see what you guys are saying here. "
"10366270","10369570"," The mic chat is slow, so I'm going to get into YouTube and see what you guys are saying."
"10370550","10371410"," Thanks, Centroids."
"10371410","10372110"," I appreciate it. "
"10374740","10376120"," Yeah, Jimmy, I'm with you, man."
"10376380","10380880"," I don't like when they tell me they're going to get below the rate of inflation and all that shit,"
"10380940","10383240"," I'm like, they're blowing smoke up your ass."
"10384460","10385700"," I'm just like, what the?"
"10386180","10388080"," He's so fucking greedy. "
"10388700","10389540"," They don't care, man."
"10392180","10394160"," The thoughts on a skip versus a pause."
"10394640","10396580"," That would be fascinating to me tomorrow. "
"10396580","10397500"," It's a good question."
"10397780","10407660"," So he can, what you're saying do, he can say something like, we're going to skip, but"
"10407660","10413260"," we're guaranteeing, we're going to do the next rate decision will be 25 or more."
"10413480","10415840"," He says some shit like that, like we're guaranteeing it. "
"10416520","10421500"," He words it correctly, even if he doesn't, that would work for the market to grind higher."
"10422420","10424060"," He comes out and pauses, man."
"10424220","10428900"," They start backpedaling and it's not going to be good for bulls. "
"10429100","10431340"," In my experience, it's not going to be good for bulls."
"10433400","10434720"," And the markets experience."
"10442040","10444120"," Can we focus on some good things that are happening?"
"10445780","10449680"," Yeah, some good things that are happening this morning, I was on the phone with a friend. "
"10449900","10455620"," So this past week started last week, actually, I'm bidding on buying houses right now."
"10455720","10458380"," I'm at County auctions trying to buy houses right now."
"10458480","10461320"," So David just said, we focus on some good things happening. "
"10461800","10468140"," There are some positives here, not just positives, but when we do get that role, how deep do we go?"
"10468920","10470620"," I was at auctions this week, right?"
"10472000","10473820"," I was getting good prices at homes."
"10474380","10478560"," People are competitively still trying to buy homes right now."
"10479040","10483600"," When they talk about two weeks ago, I read an article saying housing market's the worst it's been"
"10483600","10484500"," since 2008. "
"10484860","10489000"," I'm like, I don't know, who's asked they're blowing that smoke up under?"
"10491160","10493300"," They were like, it's the worst housing market since 2000."
"10493500","10494880"," I'm like, you're already a fucking miner."
"10495100","10504140"," If you bought a house anytime, like 2012 until COVID, basically it got really hot into COVID or"
"10504140","10505380"," leading into COVID. "
"10505540","10513440"," But my houses are fucking, you'd have to have a major bloodbath for me to even lose money."
"10513580","10514680"," And that wasn't that long ago."
"10514840","10516980"," This was seven years ago for me. "
"10517700","10523720"," So, you know, if you bought a house seven years ago, you should be, your house isn't like two"
"10523720","10525620"," thirds of its value right now, is it?"
"10526160","10536020"," Let me know in the chat if you bought a house prior to 2018-19, is your house worth two"
"10536020","10538760"," thirds less than what you bought it for?"
"10539720","10543700"," Does anybody remember Janet Yellen when she said we saved the fucking housing market?"
"10544140","10546580"," And two weeks later, housing market crashed."
"10547020","10550280"," Does anybody out there remember that shit from Janet Yellen back in the day?"
"10552020","10557060"," You know, like unless that stuff starts cracking and breaking, I don't see it."
"10560800","10562440"," You don't understand what front running is?"
"10562640","10564280"," Hey, I'll show up even more clear for you, okay?"
"10565260","10565980"," I'll make it really clear. "
"10566100","10566940"," I'll make this really simple."
"10570550","10578470"," Go on to a trading view, type in ticker symbol SPX."
"10580610","10586710"," And then I want you to type in a, I want you to add a symbol to it on a"
"10586710","10587310"," new pain. "
"10588170","10592890"," Type in the, type in the fed funds rate, type in fed funds rate."
"10593650","10596870"," You tell me what happens when we start pausing and cutting."
"10597370","10598430"," You tell me what happens. "
"10599070","10602290"," How deep that is, how deep that is, does matter."
"10603370","10606290"," But you tell me what happens historically in our stock market."
"10615550","10616610"," Yeah, stretching walls. "
"10616810","10618070"," Where the fuck do you live, man?"
"10619050","10621090"," Where do you live, bro?"
"10621510","10627450"," It's got to be like, what are you living like, like, you must live in like what, Maine or"
"10627450","10630270"," something, or I don't know where you live, man."
"10630490","10633410"," So what do you mind saying, what state you live in that you're only up 40%?"
"10637170","10637610"," Maryland."
"10638490","10640350"," Yeah, I don't know much about Maryland's housing market. "
"10640510","10643270"," I know some housing markets, some regional housing markets, but not that one."
"10643690","10644990"," So I can't comment on Maryland."
"10645610","10649070"," I was wondering if you were like, uh, New England or something outside of Massachusetts. "
"10650150","10652010"," Or like one of the, one of the other states."
"10653210","10655110"," Watch out here for a big move to the downside."
"10655930","10657570"," Spy looking bloody right now. "
"10665650","10666610"," Here in Bama."
"10666850","10670890"," So I looked in Bama recently, the housing prices are down."
"10672030","10673570"," But I tried to buy houses. "
"10673890","10677590"," Uh, I was trying to buy houses in, um, Destin, Florida."
"10679210","10682970"," Uh, just as COVID was ramping and then everyone, no one was willing to sell."
"10683270","10689430"," I watched that houses in Destin go up 40% between COVID and right now. "
"10689450","10690870"," So I don't know if I believe that statement."
"10691870","10693050"," I don't believe you."
"10693370","10695670"," They were already hot in, uh, 2019. "
"10695810","10696730"," I was looking in Alabama."
"10697290","10699570"," I was looking in, uh, Panhandle of Florida."
"10699570","10702210"," And I didn't, I didn't see that experience. "
"10702210","10702890"," Parts of Alabama."
"10703070","10703870"," You guys have seen it."
"10704130","10706050"," I looked in Alabama a month ago too. "
"10706670","10708450"," I looked in Georgia and Alabama."
"10708890","10710710"," You guys got good cost of living down there though too."
"10710970","10715470"," So maybe you don't have as much, uh, home value increases like other parts of the country. "
"10715950","10718250"," You guys have really good cost of living down there."
"10720430","10725150"," Yeah, Florida markets hot, uh, California market crazy."
"10725990","10732190"," Uh, Arizona, uh, they've blasted back down, but to reality, but they're still on trend raising as"
"10732190","10733790"," well, rising as well. "
"10739010","10741150"," About 430 K a praise of 265."
"10742510","10747010"," I was buying houses here in Detroit at one time for, uh, you don't even want to know."
"10749230","10751670"," Uh, 3500 to $25,000. "
"10752370","10757970"," I can't get a burned out shelf for less than 35 to 65, right?"
"10757970","10766150"," I burned out shelf 35 and then, uh, like something needs a rehab or a renovation."
"10767110","10770270"," No less than, uh, right now 35 to 65."
"10771290","10778390"," Renovated homes here going for, uh, 160 on the low end, high end millions of dollars. "
"10778870","10781770"," Those million dollar homes were going for 300 bucks."
"10781970","10782810"," I couldn't give away here."
"10783250","10785750"," Matter of fact rent, I live in Detroit now. "
"10785870","10787030"," I moved to Detroit for the housing boom."
"10787970","10789730"," Uh, you should see what rent is in Detroit."
"10789910","10792810"," Gwen Zillow, the little rents are in the city of Detroit. "
"10793230","10794490"," They're like thousand bucks minimum."
"10794790","10799870"," That's cheap, but, uh, they have rents here in the city for two, three, four thousand, five"
"10799870","10802690"," thousand dollars in the city and they're getting that money."
"10807010","10807790"," Oh yeah, dude. "
"10808690","10811050"," I never, I did a bunch of flips and wholesaling."
"10811350","10811990"," Never should have done that."
"10812090","10813570"," Should have held every fucking house I had. "
"10814830","10815690"," Every single one of them."
"10817990","10820250"," They're now worth like tens of multiples."
"10828450","10830350"," Yeah, this is, we're getting pretty bloody here, aren't we?"
"10830830","10832370"," We're looking to, looking to roll this shit down. "
"10834770","10836530"," Trading S three right now."
"10837470","10840770"," Sitting in break below this S three and get down to this STX buy."
"10843550","10845130"," Markets just parked right now. "
"10849780","10851180"," Let me show that on the chart."
"10853600","10854980"," Yeah, it's, it's kind of bizarre."
"10855260","10861040"," So let me, let me know in the chat, um, let me know in the chat where you think a"
"10861040","10864400"," pause makes the market go up. "
"10864400","10865360"," I'll give you something."
"10866160","10867280"," I'll say this to you."
"10868060","10874720"," If the, if the Fed does at some point pause like officially, like, hey, we're pausing and we"
"10874720","10877600"," anticipate cuts down the road, anything like that, dumbishness. "
"10878980","10882220"," Maybe you get a hundred point squeeze out of it, but is it sustainable?"
"10883140","10884240"," Is my question to you."
"10890750","10893810"," David, who are you David saying?"
"10894910","10898710"," So David, I'm saying I'm up over 300% over 15 years."
"10900890","10902590"," Uh, Stephen Hunter chime in it. "
"10902710","10904110"," Stephen, you live in Florida, don't you?"
"10904730","10907230"," Uh, I paid 450 for my house in 2015."
"10907490","10910430"," I'm never selling not barring against, let it ride at 3%."
"10910430","10911790"," I'm in your boat, Stephen. "
"10912750","10914450"," I'm never fucking selling, man."
"10914690","10916370"," No, I'm never, I don't think I'll ever sell."
"10916810","10920890"," And if you're in, and that's another thing, like most of the people, like when you look at people"
"10920890","10927750"," that are buying at a high rate, um, they're not as large portion of the home owners. "
"10928030","10933070"," Most homeowners today still bought before, uh, a raise in, in rates."
"10933730","10939510"," Well, the trick for the Fed here, if they want to see housing truly come down, if they want to"
"10939510","10942750"," see the price of housing truly come down, watch out here."
"10942810","10950810"," We've got, uh, no looking for a, uh, rug pull right now on spoos, big old rug pull coming up. "
"10953110","10958470"," If you're, if you're looking for like, uh, if you're a young person, you're like, I'm looking for"
"10958470","10960690"," not a buy a house and I can't afford it."
"10961150","10965510"," It's like my kids can't afford a buy a house and they probably won't be able to unless this"
"10965510","10965930"," happens."
"10968490","10973330"," Um, you're looking for the, there's a mechanic here in the background. "
"10974430","10984350"," If the Fed says we're cutting rates, the Fed says we're"
"10984350","10984850"," cutting rates."
"10984950","10990810"," We're pausing and we're cutting once, once they get that we're cutting, you should see a mad rush"
"10990810","10997970"," of homeowners from the 2010s that are going to downsize or upsize."
"10999630","11002710"," So let's say I bought a house in 2010, right?"
"11003390","11011050"," I raise four kids and my kids are just starting to go to school and I want to downsize at"
"11011050","11014430"," this point and I'm holding off, holding off, just like people are saying in the chat right now. "
"11015050","11017150"," It's like Stephen Hunter saying, just like I'm saying, right?"
"11017390","11018550"," I'm not going to get good rates."
"11019070","11023450"," And then all of a sudden I hear through the grapevine that Jerome Powell is going to cut rates."
"11023910","11024210"," Woohoo. "
"11024630","11025730"," What's the first thing that I do?"
"11027210","11029570"," First thing I do is try to sell at the top, right?"
"11030170","11031750"," So I'm a home, I'm not an actual homeowner."
"11032410","11039750"," I actually pay tons of taxes and I assure you that if they say we're cutting rates, I'm going to"
"11039750","11043470"," have everyone in my neighborhood attempt to sell."
"11044030","11047530"," Everybody, but I got like half my neighborhood. "
"11048230","11049290"," My neighborhood's really nice."
"11049610","11052690"," Like people in my neighborhood are starting to age out."
"11053350","11057970"," They're getting to be like 45, 55, somewhere in that age range. "
"11057970","11066770"," And I'll tell you, if they start cutting rates, it's like we're playing a Mexican standoff with"
"11066770","11067410"," each other, right?"
"11067630","11072650"," You try to sell before rates are cut so I can get out of my house at the best price."
"11073430","11076770"," And then I go and find a house at a better rate, right?"
"11078230","11083250"," And those housing prices will begin to fall rapidly when that happens."
"11083310","11085330"," Too many sellers, not enough buyers. "
"11086830","11088510"," Housing prices start to tumble really fast."
"11089830","11092130"," And so you don't want to be the last person left standing, right?"
"11092570","11097870"," So you do a $25,000 price cut trying to get your house bought before the next guy on your"
"11097870","11098870"," block or in your neighborhood."
"11099970","11102390"," And that'll actually drop prices in the market. "
"11102930","11109890"," So if you can time that appropriately, you would be selling at the top and then maybe wait six"
"11109890","11119250"," months to a year to buy that eventual housing crap, maybe not a full crash, but much cheaper"
"11119250","11120170"," prices, right?"
"11120850","11129270"," I mean, what those realtors out there, making the home owner, not the home buyer, the home owner"
"11129270","11132050"," believe that rates are coming down."
"11132550","11135250"," No one cares about you being a young person buying."
"11136010","11139150"," Now, it's not nice to say it's not cool to say, but it's true. "
"11139870","11141310"," So if I'm a home owner, right?"
"11141950","11145890"," I'm not fucking selling unless there's zero zero zero three percent, right?"
"11146450","11156130"," I'm not selling to jump into potentially seven, eight, nine, 10, 12, 20"
"11156130","11157570"," percent interest rates, right?"
"11157810","11159770"," I don't want to get involved in any of that kind of stuff."
"11159990","11165130"," So the Fed needs to do that at some point this cycle."
"11174620","11175640"," Yeah, there will. "
"11175900","11177680"," It will be the wheels dumping on the peons."
"11178640","11179080"," Absolutely."
"11179640","11186040"," Now, if you're I think Stephen Simmons, I live in this house the day that I die, he's not going"
"11186040","11188420"," to care about any of that, right?"
"11189300","11194800"," Another thing that doesn't matter these days or two more things that don't matter these days, the"
"11194800","11201360"," first one would be we're not giving any kind of variable rate mortgages to anybody where our"
"11201360","11203260"," signature loans and that kind of shit to people. "
"11203500","11206720"," And also people who want to live in their homes forever."
"11207120","11211800"," And then the last part would be a less important part be a big difference."
"11211800","11220220"," When I was young, my father was in real estate and he fucking leveraged every dollar he had. "
"11220780","11222200"," He leveraged everything."
"11222440","11223540"," He leveraged all those credit."
"11224040","11225340"," He leveraged everything that he owned. "
"11226240","11227560"," Everything did not matter."
"11227920","11229400"," He just leveraged leverage leverage."
"11230160","11232820"," And he got rich did really well. "
"11233200","11238200"," But when the market came down, he lost everything was very much like that."
"11238280","11242600"," Wherever that movie is out there with the like the the stripper with like five homes or something"
"11242600","11244280"," is very much similar to that scenario."
"11245220","11252320"," One big difference in this market that I noticed is a lot of the a lot of the real estate"
"11252320","11254120"," investors, it's cash dude. "
"11254900","11257860"," It's like like so they'll pay cash for a home."
"11258580","11264060"," I don't think they were taking loans against those cash purchases with zero percent on them and"
"11264060","11265780"," turning these homes into rental properties."
"11266300","11267760"," That's a fucking travesty. "
"11267880","11269020"," But that is what happened."
"11269960","11272060"," We're turning in Joe Donut said it."
"11272160","11276700"," We're turning into very much like England where most people are renters now. "
"11277380","11279580"," Blood right now trained below S3."
"11280740","11283280"," Looking for more downside than that though."
"11283400","11287700"," We're looking for 439.02. We'll see if we can get it here. "
"11289580","11295640"," So you know like as a like the one big difference here is most of my friends cash buyers cash"
"11295640","11301300"," buyers cash buyers and cash buyer doesn't care about the price of the property as long as the"
"11301300","11307760"," rentals the rental pay over a set period of time like hey over 10 years when we're going to make"
"11307760","11309160"," over 20 years what am I going to make."
"11309600","11313960"," They're going to 20% ROI on this property regardless of the where market goes."
"11314240","11317640"," Can it support one, two, three thousand dollars through all of this?"
"11323670","11325250"," Well there's another thing too. "
"11325630","11331150"," So a study was done in the oh seven crash and the 2000 crash."
"11331990","11333670"," There was a big two big studies done."
"11333870","11339630"," I think I don't remember who put the studies out but don't pull me on this right now exactly but"
"11339630","11348750"," I think at that time period we were short rental housing by 20% 15 or 20%"
"11348750","11357910"," and we actually ramped up we actually ramped up building homes in that from then until now we were"
"11357910","11365170"," still short rentals in this country and then running into this cycle specifically there was a"
"11365170","11373430"," thought process that whenever we get a crash which we have not had believe it or not even if you"
"11373430","11379690"," think we've had a crash we have not but whenever we get a crash that we would increase to 30"
"11379690","11388570"," to 35 percent shortage in home rentals that that's what sparked well that's part of what sparked"
"11388570","11396210"," all these banks building rental homes right just whole communities of rental homes anticipating"
"11396210","11402370"," that even even more increased need for renters in the United States. "
"11402910","11408130"," It's also another revenue stream for them because they used to not trade the stock market now they"
"11408130","11412370"," do and now they have they need a new revenue stream so they always have higher and higher profits."
"11412750","11416450"," I don't know if he has no all that but that's why you see black rock and shit like that"
"11416450","11420070"," getting involved in the rental market where they were never in that market to that extent"
"11420070","11422610"," residential real estate rental rental market."
"11424670","11444720"," It's a chasing chasing yield park"
"11444720","11446620"," on S3 right now. "
"11457640","11462860"," Yes I don't know much about what to say to you as a bull if you're a bull you want"
"11462860","11470520"," higher for longer and in my own view you want higher for longer and whatever that role does become"
"11470520","11479980"," whatever they do pause and roll rates hopefully the market goes down to 380 400 that's what you're"
